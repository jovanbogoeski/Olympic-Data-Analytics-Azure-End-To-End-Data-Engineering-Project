  "name": "Olympics-Ingestion-Pipeline",
  "properties": {
    "activities": [
      {
        "name": "CopyAthletesCSV",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": ["AthletesSource"],
        "outputs": ["ADLSRaw"],
        "typeProperties": {
          "source": {
            "type": "DelimitedTextSource"
          },

}
This ingests CSVs (Athletes, Coaches, Medals, Teams, EntriesGender) into ADLS raw zone.

3️⃣ Data Transformation (Databricks + Delta Lake)
Example PySpark ETL:

# Load raw data
df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("abfss://raw@datalake.dfs.core.windows.net/athletes.csv")

# Clean data
df = df.dropna().dropDuplicates()

# Write to transformed zone (Delta format)
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("abfss://transformed@datalake.dfs.core.windows.net/athletes_delta")
4️⃣ Analytics Layer (Synapse)
Create external tables in Synapse to query Delta files in ADLS.

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dbo.Athletes
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'athletes_delta',
    DATA_SOURCE = OlympicDataLake,
    FILE_FORMAT = DeltaLakeFormat
)
AS SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT='DELTA'
) AS rows;
5️⃣ Dashboards (Power BI)
Connect Power BI to Synapse.

Would you like me to also add a 📂 Project Structure block (with data/raw, notebooks/, pipelines/) so your repo looks even more complete?

You said:
I need to decide on the project structure right now. First I have the diagram in draw io. I have the notebook as well(single one in databrciks). Then I have some sql quesries in azure synapse how to do all of that(structure)
ChatGPT said:
Great timing ⚡ Jovan — deciding on the project structure now will make your repo clean and portfolio-ready. Since you already have:

✅ an architecture diagram (in draw.io),

✅ a single Databricks notebook,

✅ some SQL queries in Synapse,

…you should structure the repo in a way that mirrors the data engineering pipeline you built. Recruiters and reviewers should be able to quickly see:

Architecture → diagram

Pipelines → ingestion

Notebooks → transformations

Queries → analytics

Dashboards → reporting

📌 Why this works
images/ → keeps your diagram separate, referenced in README

pipelines/ → houses your Azure Data Factory pipeline JSONs (ADF allows export/import)

notebooks/ → stores your Databricks ETL code (export .dbc or .py)

sql/ → holds Synapse SQL queries (table creation, analytics queries)

dashboards/ → Power BI files or screenshots

data/ → you don’t need to upload full CSVs (since GitHub size is limited), but you can link the raw sources here

📖 Next Steps for You
Export your diagram from Draw.io → save as architecture.png → put in images/.

Export Databricks notebook → File > Export > Source File → save as olympics_etl.py → put in notebooks/.

Save your Synapse queries → copy SQL into .sql files → put in sql/.

(Optional) Export ADF pipeline JSON → from Azure portal → put in pipelines/.

(Optional) Add Power BI dashboard file (.pbix) → in dashboards/.

Update README.md → link to each folder so people can navigate easily.

👉 Question for you: do you want your repo to contain actual CSV datasets (small ones, like 1–2 MB) inside data/, or should we just provide links to the GitHub raw files (lighter, easier)?

You said:
What about the source files or?
ChatGPT said:
Great that you brought this up 👌 — handling source files (datasets, pipeline definitions, notebooks, etc.) is a key repo design decision. Let’s break it down:

📂 How to Handle Source Files
1. Datasets (Olympic CSVs)
Option A (best for portfolio): Don’t upload CSVs (they’re often large and copyrighted).
🔗 Instead, keep a data/README.md that links to the raw GitHub dataset sources (like Darshil Parmar’s repo).
Example:

# Data Sources
- [Athletes.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darshilparmar/olympic-data/main/Athletes.csv)
- [Coaches.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darshilparmar/olympic-data/main/Coaches.csv)
- [Medals.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darshilparmar/olympic-data/main/Medals.csv)
- [Teams.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darshilparmar/olympic-data/main/Teams.csv)
- [EntriesGender.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darshilparmar/olympic-data/main/EntriesGender.csv)
Option B (lightweight demo): Upload tiny sample files (first 100 rows).
That way reviewers can run your pipeline locally without pulling full data.

2. Databricks Notebook
Export your notebook as:

.py (Python source file) → human-readable, version-controllable ✅

.dbc (Databricks archive) → preserves formatting, but less GitHub-friendly

I recommend keeping both:

notebooks/
  olympics_etl.py     # readable source
  olympics_etl.dbc    # native Databricks format
3. ADF Pipeline Definitions
You can export ADF pipelines as JSON from Azure.

Store them in /pipelines/:

pipelines/
  adf_ingestion.json
4. Synapse SQL Queries
Save each SQL script into /sql/:

sql/
  create_external_tables.sql
  analytics_queries.sql
Each file should start with a short comment explaining what it does.

5. Architecture Diagram
Keep your .drawio source file + exported .png:

images/
  architecture.drawio
  architecture.png
6. Power BI Dashboard
If you built a Power BI file, save the .pbix in /dashboards/.

Add screenshot .png for GitHub preview:

dashboards/
  olympics.pbix
  medals_dashboard.png

👉 So to answer your question:

Source files like datasets → don’t upload full, link them.

Source files you created (notebooks, pipelines, SQL, diagrams, dashboards) → keep them in repo.

Do you want me to write the data/README.md file with direct raw GitHub links to all Olympic CSVs, so you can just drop it in your repo?

You said:
Lets go step by step. First I need to create images folder right
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 18s
Yep — start with an images/ folder. Here’s the quickest way, plus how to get your draw.io diagram in there and wire it into the README.

1) Create the folder
Option A — Git (Windows PowerShell / macOS/Linux Terminal)

mkdir images
# (optional) keep folder tracked even if empty
New-Item -Path images\.gitkeep -ItemType File  # PowerShell
# or
touch images/.gitkeep                          # macOS/Linux
Option B — GitHub web

Go to your repo → Add file → Create new file

Type images/.gitkeep as the filename → Commit.

2) Put your diagram in images/
In draw.io (diagrams.net):

File → Save As… → save the source as images/architecture.drawio

File → Export As → PNG

Suggested: Transparent background (optional), Scale 2x, Border 10 px, Width 1600–2200 px

Save as images/architecture.png

(If you prefer SVG: Export As → SVG → images/architecture.svg — renders crisp on GitHub.)

3) Reference it in your README
Add this where you want the diagram to appear:

![Architecture Diagram](./images/architecture.png)
(If you exported SVG: ./images/architecture.svg)

4) Commit
git add images/*
git commit -m "Add architecture diagram (drawio + png) and images folder"
git push
Want me to generate a tiny images/README.md with tips (export settings, naming, alt text) and add it next?

You said:
ype images/.gitkeep as the filename → Commit. this will create the folder
ChatGPT said:
Exactly ✅

On GitHub, if you type images/.gitkeep as the filename when creating a new file, GitHub will:

Create the images/ folder

Put an empty file named .gitkeep inside it

Since Git doesn’t track empty folders by default, .gitkeep is just a placeholder to make sure the folder exists in your repo. Later, when you upload your diagram (architecture.drawio and architecture.png), you can delete .gitkeep if you want — it’s not required once the folder has real files.

👉 Do you want me to show you the exact step-by-step clicks in GitHub UI to create that images/ folder with .gitkeep?

You said:
Yes I did. Now I need to update both draw.io file and image or?
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👌 you’ve got the images/ folder in place.

Now yes — you should add both files to keep things professional:

architecture.drawio → the source file (so you can re-edit later).

architecture.png (or .svg) → the exported image that GitHub can display in your README.

🔹 Workflow
Open your diagram in draw.io (diagrams.net).

Save the source:

File → Save As… → .drawio

Name it architecture.drawio and upload it to images/.

Export an image for README:

File → Export As → PNG (or SVG for sharper scaling).

Name it architecture.png (or architecture.svg) and upload to images/.

🔹 Link it in README
In your README, point to the PNG (or SVG):

![Architecture Diagram](./images/architecture.png)
✅ That way:

architecture.drawio = editable source for you.

architecture.png = rendered image for readers.

👉 Do you want me to also suggest export settings for the PNG (resolution, transparency, border) so it looks crisp on GitHub?

You said:
Uploaded image
Is my diagram correct
ChatGPT said:
Yes 🙌 your diagram is correct and it matches the Azure medallion-style flow you’re building. Let me break it down against best practice:

✅ What looks good
Data Source → ADF → Raw Data Store (ADLS)
→ Correctly shows ingestion into the Bronze layer.

Raw Data Store → Databricks → Transformed Data (ADLS)
→ Exactly how Silver/Gold data is prepared.

Transformed Data → Synapse → Power BI
→ Classic serving pattern: ADLS Delta → SQL analytics → dashboards.

Direct Databricks → Synapse connection
→ Valid: you can expose data straight from Databricks if needed.

Shapes + Logos
→ Professional and clear — very portfolio-friendly.

🔹 Small improvements you might consider
Add Zone Labels (Bronze, Silver, Gold)

Raw Data Store → Bronze

Transformed Data → Silver/Gold

Clarify that Synapse can read directly from ADLS

You already show the arrow, but adding a label like “External Tables” or “PolyBase” helps.

Optional: Power BI direct to ADLS

Sometimes Power BI connects straight to Delta tables (via Databricks or Synapse).

Not essential, but you could add a dashed line to show it’s possible.

👉 But as it stands: your diagram is correct and consistent with the README + project structure.

Do you want me to annotate your diagram with Bronze/Silver/Gold labels so it’s even clearer for employers?

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 Adding Bronze / Silver / Gold labels will make your architecture look much more “real-world” and aligned with the medallion architecture that recruiters love to see.

Here’s how you should annotate your diagram in draw.io:

🔹 Suggested Changes
Raw Data Store (ADLS Gen2)

Add a label underneath:
“Bronze Layer – Raw, unprocessed data”

Transformed Data (ADLS Gen2)

Add a label underneath:
“Silver/Gold Layer – Cleaned, curated, ready for analytics”

Databricks box

Optionally add a small tag like:
“ETL / Delta Processing”

Synapse box

Add a note:
“SQL Analytics / External Tables”

Power BI box

Add a note:
“Interactive Dashboards”

🔹 Visual Example (textual layout)
 Raw Data Store (ADLS Gen2)
 [ Bronze Layer – Raw data ]

 Transformed Data (ADLS Gen2)
 [ Silver/Gold Layer – Curated data ]
🔹 Optional Styling Tips
Use lighter gray text for the layer labels so they don’t overwhelm the logos.

Use rounded rectangles or “annotation” shapes in draw.io.

Keep everything aligned horizontally like you already have — it looks very professional.

👉 Do you want me to prepare a modified version of your diagram with these labels (I can annotate your PNG), or would you prefer a step-by-step guide in draw.io so you can edit the .drawio file yourself?

You said:
Sure I understand thank you very much. After images what is next
ChatGPT said:
Nice 🚀 you’re on track! After setting up the images/ folder and committing your diagram (.drawio + .png), the next logical step is:

📂 Step 2: notebooks/ Folder
Since you already have a Databricks ETL notebook, let’s store it properly.

🔹 What to do
In Databricks:

Open your notebook

Go to File → Export → Source File → download as .py

(Optional) also export as .dbc if you want to preserve native format

In your repo, create a folder:

notebooks/
Save your file(s):

notebooks/
  olympics_etl.py      # Python version (human-readable, Git-friendly)
  olympics_etl.dbc     # Optional Databricks archive
🔹 Why both?
.py = readable, easy to version control

.dbc = if someone imports into Databricks, they get formatting & widgets

📂 Step 3: sql/ Folder
After notebooks, you’ll want to store your Synapse SQL scripts:

sql/
  create_external_tables.sql   # for connecting Synapse to ADLS Delta
  analytics_queries.sql        # example queries (medals by country, gender breakdown, etc.)
📂 Step 4: pipelines/ Folder
Export your Azure Data Factory pipeline JSONs into:

pipelines/
  adf_ingestion.json
📂 Step 5: dashboards/ Folder
If you build Power BI dashboards, store:

dashboards/
  olympics.pbix
  medals_dashboard.png
👉 So the sequence is:

✅ images/ → done

➡️ Next: notebooks/ (export & add your Databricks ETL code)

Then: sql/

Then: pipelines/

Finally: dashboards/

⚡ Do you want me to show you exactly how to export your Databricks notebook into .py and .dbc so you can start with notebooks/ right now?

You said:
Uploaded image
Ipython notebook right
ChatGPT said:
Good screenshot 👍 that’s the Databricks export menu.

Here’s what each option means and what you should use for your repo:

DBC archive → Databricks’ own format (best for re-import into Databricks, not Git-friendly).

Source file → Exports as a .py (Python) script (best for GitHub repos ✅).

IPython Notebook → Exports as .ipynb (like Jupyter). Good if you want to show code + outputs inline, but heavier and less clean for Git.

HTML → Static read-only file, not really useful for code versioning.

🔹 Recommendation for your repo
Export Source file (.py) → put in notebooks/olympics_etl.py

(Optional) also export DBC archive → put in notebooks/olympics_etl.dbc

Skip IPython/HTML unless you specifically want Jupyter-style rendering.

👉 So the answer: choose "Source file" for GitHub.
Then commit it under notebooks/.

Do you want me to draft the folder + README snippet for notebooks/ so visitors know how to use your ETL code?

You said:
Source file → Exports as a .py (Python) script (best for GitHub repos ✅). but it downloaded in notepad
ChatGPT said:
That’s totally fine 👍 — what happened is:

Databricks exported your notebook as a .py file (Python script).

Since Windows doesn’t know which app you want to use, it opens it with Notepad by default.

But it’s still a valid Python file (you’ll see # Databricks notebook source comments inside).

✅ What to do next
Don’t worry that it opens in Notepad — the file is fine.

Rename it if needed → e.g. olympics_etl.py

Move it into your repo under:

notebooks/
  olympics_etl.py
Commit & push:

git add notebooks/olympics_etl.py
git commit -m "Add Databricks ETL notebook as Python source file"
git push
🔹 Optional
If you want GitHub to render the notebook in a more interactive way (like Jupyter), you can also export as IPython Notebook (.ipynb) and put it alongside your .py.

Example:

notebooks/
  olympics_etl.py
  olympics_etl.ipynb
👉 Do you want me to show you how to make a small README.md inside the notebooks/ folder explaining how someone can import/run your ETL code in Databricks?

You said:
I need to create the notebook folder in github via interface now right
ChatGPT said:
Exactly ✅

Since you’re doing this step-by-step through GitHub’s web interface, here’s how to create the notebooks/ folder and upload your .py file:

🔹 Create notebooks/ folder on GitHub
Go to your repository on GitHub.

Click “Add file” → “Create new file”.

In the filename box, type:

notebooks/.gitkeep
(this forces GitHub to create the folder).

Scroll down → Commit new file.

Now you’ll see a notebooks/ folder in your repo.

🔹 Upload your Databricks notebook
Open the new notebooks/ folder in your repo.

Click “Add file” → “Upload files”.

Drag and drop your exported .py file (e.g., olympics_etl.py).

Commit the change.

✅ Done — now your repo will have:

notebooks/
  olympics_etl.py
👉 Do you also want to include the .ipynb version (so GitHub can render it like a Jupyter notebook), or just keep the .py for now?

You said:
Uploaded image
Ok like this
ChatGPT said:
Yes ✅ exactly like that — your repo now looks professional with:

images/ → where you’ll keep your architecture diagram (.drawio + .png)

notebooks/olympics_etl.py → your Databricks ETL notebook in source form

README.md → main project documentation

LICENSE → good practice for open projects

🔹 Next Steps in Order
Add your architecture diagram

Commit both images/architecture.drawio and images/architecture.png.

Update your README.md to display the PNG:

![Architecture Diagram](./images/architecture.png)
Create sql/ folder

Save your Synapse SQL queries as .sql files.

Example:

sql/
  create_external_tables.sql
  analytics_queries.sql
Create pipelines/ folder (optional, if you exported ADF pipeline JSON).

pipelines/
  adf_ingestion.json
Create dashboards/ folder (optional, if you want to include your Power BI report).

dashboards/
  olympics.pbix
  sample_dashboard.png
👉 Do you want me to write out a ready-made sql/create_external_tables.sql for your Synapse so you can just drop it in your repo?

You said:
Can I add data folder with all csv files or?
ChatGPT said:
Great question 👍 — you can add a data/ folder with CSVs, but there are a few important trade-offs.

🔹 Option 1: Add full CSVs into data/
✅ Pro: Everything is in one repo, people can run your pipeline without external downloads.

❌ Con: GitHub repos aren’t ideal for large datasets (file size limit 100 MB per file, 1 GB recommended total).

❌ Con: Makes your repo heavier to clone, and recruiters don’t usually need full raw data.

🔹 Option 2: Add only sample CSVs
Upload small versions (like first 100 rows) into data/sample/.

Keep a data/README.md with links to the full raw datasets.

✅ This keeps repo light but still runnable for demo.

Example:

data/
  sample/
    Athletes_sample.csv
    Medals_sample.csv
  README.md   # contains links to full raw files
🔹 Option 3: No CSVs, just links
Store only a README inside data/ with raw GitHub links:

# Data Sources

- [Athletes.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darshilparmar/olympic-data/main/Athletes.csv)
- [Coaches.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darshilparmar/olympic-data/main/Coaches.csv)
- [Medals.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darshilparmar/olympic-data/main/Medals.csv)
- [Teams.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darshilparmar/olympic-data/main/Teams.csv)
- [EntriesGender.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darshilparmar/olympic-data/main/EntriesGender.csv)
✅ This is what most portfolio projects do — repo stays small, but still reproducible.

🔹 My recommendation
👉 For your Olympic Data Analytics portfolio, go with Option 2:

Add sample CSVs for demonstration

Provide links to the full data in data/README.md

That way, your repo looks professional, lightweight, and easy for anyone to clone.

Would you like me to generate the data/README.md file with all the correct raw GitHub CSV links for you?

You said:
Ok so after notebooks what to create next
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 You’ve got this really well organized already. After notebooks/, the natural next step is:

📂 Step 3: sql/ Folder
Since you already have some Synapse SQL queries, this is the right time to structure them.

🔹 How to do it
In GitHub → Add file → Create new file

Type:

sql/.gitkeep
→ Commit (this creates the folder).

Then add your SQL scripts, for example:

sql/
  create_external_tables.sql     # CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE statements
  analytics_queries.sql          # SELECT queries for dashboards
🔹 What goes inside
create_external_tables.sql
This should contain the SQL for connecting Synapse to your ADLS Delta tables. Example:

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dbo.Athletes
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'athletes_delta',
    DATA_SOURCE = OlympicDataLake,
    FILE_FORMAT = DeltaLakeFormat
)
AS
SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT='DELTA'
) AS rows;
analytics_queries.sql
Here you can keep your reporting queries, e.g.:

-- Medal tally by country
SELECT Country, COUNT(Medal) AS TotalMedals
FROM Medals
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY TotalMedals DESC;

-- Gender distribution
SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) AS Athletes
FROM Athletes
GROUP BY Gender;
🔹 Next Steps Roadmap
✅ images/ → done

✅ notebooks/ → done

➡️ sql/ → next

Then: pipelines/ (ADF JSON exports)

Finally: dashboards/ (Power BI file + screenshots)

Optional: data/ (samples + links)

👉 Do you want me to prepare ready-made starter files (create_external_tables.sql and analytics_queries.sql) so you can just drop them into your new sql/ folder?

You said:
But I need first help with azure synapse and creating those sqls
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 23s
Great question—this is the right time to nail Synapse + SQL.
Because your gold data is in Delta format from Databricks, you have a few options for querying it from Synapse SQL:

Choose your path
A) Easiest/robust (recommended):
Have Databricks materialize a Parquet “serve” copy of your curated tables (a snapshot) in ADLS, and point Synapse serverless SQL at those Parquet folders.

✅ Fast to set up

✅ 100% compatible with Synapse serverless SQL

♻️ Re-write the snapshot whenever you refresh your gold tables

B) Dedicated SQL pool:
Load from ADLS into dedicated SQL with COPY INTO (good for very fast BI queries, but adds cost & management).

C) Synapse Spark:
Query Delta directly using Synapse Spark (Scala/PySpark), then expose views to Power BI. (You asked for SQL specifically, so I’ll focus on A.)

Path A (recommended): Serverless SQL over Parquet snapshot
Step 1 — In Databricks: write a Parquet snapshot for Synapse
Pick a clear path for Synapse to read (e.g. abfss://transformed@<account>.dfs.core.windows.net/serve/).

# Example: create Parquet snapshots for two gold tables
gold_athletes = spark.read.format("delta").load("abfss://transformed@<ACCOUNT>.dfs.core.windows.net/gold/athletes_delta")
gold_medals   = spark.read.format("delta").load("abfss://transformed@<ACCOUNT>.dfs.core.windows.net/gold/medals_delta")

(
  gold_athletes
  .coalesce(1)                                   # optional: fewer files for demo; remove for big data
  .write.mode("overwrite")
  .format("parquet")
  .save("abfss://transformed@<ACCOUNT>.dfs.core.windows.net/serve/athletes/")
)

(
  gold_medals
  .coalesce(1)
  .write.mode("overwrite")
  .format("parquet")
  .save("abfss://transformed@<ACCOUNT>.dfs.core.windows.net/serve/medals/")
)
Replace <ACCOUNT> with your storage account name.
Keep doing this for each table you want to query from Synapse.

Step 2 — Grant Synapse access to ADLS
Give your Synapse workspace managed identity Storage Blob Data Reader on the ADLS account/container (RBAC).

In Azure Portal → Storage Account → Access control (IAM) → Add role assignment.

Role: Storage Blob Data Reader → Assign to: Synapse workspace managed identity.

Step 3 — In Synapse (serverless SQL): create external objects
Create a database, credential, data source, and external file format.
Put the following into sql/01_create_external_objects.sql:

-- 1) Create (or use) a DB
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS OlympicLake;
GO
USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- 2) Create a database scoped credential using Managed Identity
-- (works when Synapse workspace MI has RBAC on the storage)
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

-- 3) External data source pointing to your container
--    Change container, account, and (optionally) subfolder
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'abfss://transformed@<ACCOUNT>.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO

-- 4) Parquet file format
CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT ParquetFormat
WITH (FORMAT_TYPE = PARQUET);
GO
Replace <ACCOUNT> with your storage account (e.g., tokyoolympicdatajovan).

Step 4 — Create external tables over the Parquet snapshot
Put this in sql/02_external_tables_parquet.sql:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Athletes external table (reads Parquet snapshot written by Databricks)
IF OBJECT_ID('ext_athletes') IS NOT NULL DROP EXTERNAL TABLE ext_athletes;
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ext_athletes
WITH (
    LOCATION = '/serve/athletes/',         -- points to the Parquet folder
    DATA_SOURCE = OlympicDataLake,
    FILE_FORMAT = ParquetFormat
)
AS
SELECT * FROM
    OPENROWSET(
        BULK '/serve/athletes/',
        DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
        FORMAT = 'PARQUET'
    ) AS src;
GO

-- Medals external table
IF OBJECT_ID('ext_medals') IS NOT NULL DROP EXTERNAL TABLE ext_medals;
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ext_medals
WITH (
    LOCATION = '/serve/medals/',
    DATA_SOURCE = OlympicDataLake,
    FILE_FORMAT = ParquetFormat
)
AS
SELECT * FROM
    OPENROWSET(
        BULK '/serve/medals/',
        DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
        FORMAT = 'PARQUET'
    ) AS src;
GO
Notes
• CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE … AS SELECT (CETAS) materializes files under the LOCATION you specify.
• If you prefer schema-on-read (no CETAS write), skip the AS SELECT and just SELECT … OPENROWSET directly in views (shown below).

Step 5 — Create views for analytics (nice for Power BI)
Put this in sql/03_views.sql:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Example: Medal tally by country
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_medal_tally AS
SELECT Country, COUNT(*) AS TotalMedals
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK '/serve/medals/',
        DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
        FORMAT = 'PARQUET'
     ) AS m
GROUP BY Country;

-- Example: Gender distribution of athletes
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_gender_distribution AS
SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) AS Athletes
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK '/serve/athletes/',
        DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
        FORMAT = 'PARQUET'
     ) AS a
GROUP BY Gender;

-- Example: Top N countries by medals (parameter via Power BI)
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_top_countries AS
SELECT TOP 20 Country, COUNT(*) AS TotalMedals
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK '/serve/medals/',
        DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
        FORMAT = 'PARQUET'
     ) AS m
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY TotalMedals DESC;
How this plugs into your repo
Create the sql/ folder and drop these files in:

sql/
  01_create_external_objects.sql
  02_external_tables_parquet.sql
  03_views.sql
Update placeholders (<ACCOUNT>) and folder names to match your ADLS layout.

Refresh cycle (very important)
Whenever your gold Delta tables update in Databricks, overwrite the Parquet snapshot again:

gold_athletes.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("abfss://transformed@<ACCOUNT>.dfs.core.windows.net/serve/athletes/")
gold_medals.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("abfss://transformed@<ACCOUNT>.dfs.core.windows.net/serve/medals/")
Because serverless SQL is schema-on-read, your Synapse views will immediately reflect the new data (no re-ingest!).

If you want, I can tailor the scripts with your exact storage account, container, and folder names (I see tokyoolympicdatajovan/tokyo-olumpic-data in your notebook). Share the exact ADLS paths you used for the “serve” Parquet folders and I’ll fill them in for you.

You said:
But those are delta tables what to do
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16s
Great point — if your curated data is stored as Delta tables, you don’t have to convert to Parquet just to use Synapse.
You can query Delta Lake directly from Synapse serverless SQL with OPENROWSET … FORMAT = 'DELTA'. The trick is to use views (schema-on-read). External tables over Delta aren’t supported; views are the clean path.

Below is a ready-to-drop sql/ set you can add to your repo. I’ll tailor it to the names I see in your notebook:

Storage account: tokyoolympicdatajovan

Container: tokyo-olumpic-data (keep your exact spelling)

Delta locations (examples):

gold/medals_delta/
(each folder must contain a _delta_log/)

1) sql/01_create_external_objects.sql
Creates DB, managed-identity credential, and an external data source pointing to your ADLS Gen2.

-- Create (or use) a database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS OlympicLake;
GO
USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Use Synapse workspace Managed Identity (grant it Storage Blob Data Reader on the storage account)
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

-- External data source to your ADLS Gen2 container
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
Azure Portal → Storage account → Access control (IAM) → Add role assignment → Storage Blob Data Reader → assign to your Synapse workspace managed identity.

2) sql/02_views_over_delta.sql
Create views that read your Delta tables directly.

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Tip: Explicit schemas improve stability and query folding in tools.
-- If you don't know exact columns yet, you can start with SELECT * and add a WITH(...) later.

-- Athletes (Delta)
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_athletes AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'gold/athletes_delta/',                  -- folder that contains _delta_log
        DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
        FORMAT = 'DELTA'
     ) WITH (
        AthleteID       INT,
        Name            NVARCHAR(200),
        NOC             NVARCHAR(10),
        Discipline      NVARCHAR(100),
        Gender          NVARCHAR(10),
        BirthDate       DATE
     ) AS A;
GO

-- Medals (Delta)
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_medals AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
        BULK 'gold/medals_delta/',
        DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
        FORMAT = 'DELTA'
     ) WITH (
        AthleteID       INT,
        Country         NVARCHAR(100),
        Sport           NVARCHAR(100),
        Event           NVARCHAR(200),
        Medal           NVARCHAR(20),
        Year            INT
     ) AS M;
GO
Adjust column names/types to your real schema. They must match the Delta schema written by Databricks.

3) sql/03_analytics_queries.sql
Handy views for Power BI.

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Medal tally by country
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_medal_tally AS
SELECT Country, COUNT(*) AS TotalMedals
FROM vw_medals
WHERE Medal IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Country;

-- Gender distribution
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_gender_distribution AS
SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) AS Athletes
FROM vw_athletes
GROUP BY Gender;

-- Top countries by medals (top 20)
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW vw_top_countries AS
SELECT TOP 20 Country, COUNT(*) AS TotalMedals
FROM vw_medals
WHERE Medal IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY TotalMedals DESC;
Important Delta compatibility notes (Synapse serverless SQL)
Works with Delta tables written by Databricks as long as you don’t enable advanced column mapping modes or features Synapse can’t read (e.g., column mapping by name, generated columns).

Folder you point to must contain _delta_log/.

If you ever hit a read error due to an advanced Delta feature, your fallback is to write a read-only Parquet snapshot from Databricks to a /serve/.../ folder (I can give you that snippet again), but try Delta first — it usually works.

How to use this now
Create sql/ in your repo and add those three files.

In Synapse SQL editor (serverless), run them in order:

01_create_external_objects.sql

02_views_over_delta.sql (fix schemas/paths if needed)

03_analytics_queries.sql

Connect Power BI to Synapse serverless (Serverless SQL endpoint) and select the OlympicLake DB views.

If you paste your exact Delta folder paths (e.g., abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net/gold/athletes_delta/), I’ll fill them into the scripts precisely and, if you want, infer column schemas from your Databricks code so you can copy-paste without edits.

This is in my transformed folder. But what is the easiest way what to do. 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👌 thanks for sharing the screenshot — I can see your Delta folder clearly:

It has _delta_log/ → ✅ confirms it’s a valid Delta Lake table.

It also has Parquet part-00000… files → these are the actual data files.

So you’ve already done the Databricks → ADLS Delta write step correctly.

🔹 Now: What’s the easiest way forward?
Option A (direct Delta access from Synapse)
Use Synapse serverless SQL to query your Delta folder directly with OPENROWSET … FORMAT = 'DELTA'.

✅ Easiest, no extra steps.

⚠️ Sometimes breaks if you use advanced Delta features (column mapping, generated columns, etc.).

👉 SQL example (adjust container & account):

SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'gold/athletes_delta/',   -- path to your folder
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
Where OlympicDataLake is the external data source pointing to your storage (created in my earlier script).

Option B (Parquet snapshot for Synapse)
From Databricks, write a Parquet copy of your Delta table into a /serve/ folder.

Synapse then queries the Parquet snapshot, which is always supported.

✅ Most reliable.

❌ Extra step: re-write snapshot each time data updates.

👉 Example in Databricks:

delta_df = spark.read.format("delta").load("abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net/gold/athletes_delta/")

delta_df.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net/serve/athletes/")
Then in Synapse SQL:

SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'serve/athletes/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'PARQUET'
) AS rows;
🔹 My recommendation (for you right now)
👉 Start with Option A (direct Delta).

It’s already there.

Works in most Synapse serverless setups.

Faster to get running with your current pipeline.

If you run into schema/compatibility issues, then fall back to Option B (Parquet snapshot).

✅ Next step for you:

Create the external data source in Synapse pointing to your ADLS container.

Then run a simple Delta query like the one above to test if it works.

Do you want me to write the exact SQL script for your storage account tokyoolympicdatajovan and container tokyo-olumpic-data, so you can copy-paste it directly into Synapse and test?

I am here now where to go
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — you’re inside your Synapse Analytics workspace (tokyo-olympic-sn) 🎉

Here’s what to do next so you can query your Delta tables:

🔹 Step 1 — Open the SQL scripts area
On the left sidebar, click the “Data” icon (looks like a database).

Or click the “Develop” (</>) icon → this is where you can create SQL scripts.

🔹 Step 2 — Create a new SQL script
Click “New” → “SQL Script” (top left, blue button).

In the editor that opens, paste this script to set up your connection to ADLS:

-- Create (or use) a database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS OlympicLake;
GO
USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Create a credential that uses Synapse Managed Identity
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

-- External data source pointing to your ADLS container
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
⚠️ Make sure your Synapse workspace managed identity has Storage Blob Data Reader role on the storage account (tokyoolympicdatajovan).

🔹 Step 3 — Test querying a Delta table
Open a new SQL script in Synapse and run:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'gold/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
If everything is set up correctly, you should see rows from your Delta table 🚀

🔹 Step 4 — Save your scripts into your repo
Once you confirm it works, copy your SQL into files in your GitHub sql/ folder:

01_create_external_objects.sql

02_test_delta_query.sql

03_views.sql (later for analytics views)

👉 Do you want me to also walk you through how to assign the “Storage Blob Data Reader” role to your Synapse workspace identity in the Azure Portal (so that the OPENROWSET query works)?

You said:

Where
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — you’re in the Data tab of Synapse. This is where you can manage databases, tables, and linked storage.

Here’s how to continue:

🔹 Step 1 — Switch to "Develop"
Look at the left sidebar (where you see icons).

Click on the one that looks like </> (Develop).
👉 This opens the place to write SQL scripts.

🔹 Step 2 — Create a new SQL script
At the top left, click the “+” button → SQL script.

This opens a SQL editor window.

🔹 Step 3 — Paste the external data source script
Paste this into your new SQL script:

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS OlympicLake;
GO
USE OlympicLake;
GO

CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
🔹 Step 4 — Run a test query on your Delta
Now try:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'gold/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
⚠️ Important: This will only work if your Synapse workspace’s managed identity has been given Storage Blob Data Reader access to your storage account.

👉 Do you want me to guide you through how to assign that role in the Azure Portal before you test this query?

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 let’s give your Synapse workspace managed identity permission on your storage account. Without this, Synapse can’t read your Delta files.

🔹 Step 1 — Go to your Storage Account
In the Azure Portal, search for your storage account:
tokyoolympicdatajovan

Click on it to open the storage account blade.

🔹 Step 2 — Open Access Control (IAM)
In the left menu of the storage account, scroll down and select Access control (IAM).

At the top, click + Add → Add role assignment.

🔹 Step 3 — Choose the Role
In the Role tab, search for:
Storage Blob Data Reader

Select it and click Next.

🔹 Step 4 — Assign to Synapse Managed Identity
In the Members tab → choose Managed identity.

Select:

Synapse workspace → tokyo-olympic-sn

System-assigned managed identity

Confirm and click Review + Assign.

🔹 Step 5 — Test in Synapse
Back in your Synapse Studio → run this query again:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'gold/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
If permissions are correct ✅ you should see results from your Delta table.

👉 Do you want me to also prepare the SQL files for your GitHub sql/ folder (so you can commit the exact scripts you’ll run here)?

You said:

ChatGPT said:
Yes ✅ exactly like that — you’ve done it correctly.

Role: Storage Blob Data Reader

Assign access to: Managed identity

Selected member: your Synapse workspace tokyo-olympic-sn

🔹 Next steps
Click Select (bottom right).

Then click Next → Review + assign.

Confirm with Review + assign again.

This will grant your Synapse workspace managed identity permission to read from your storage account (tokyoolympicdatajovan).

🔹 After that
Go back to Synapse Studio → Develop (</>) → New SQL script and run this test query:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'gold/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
If everything is correct, you should see rows from your Delta table 🎉

👉 Do you want me to prepare the exact SQL script for creating the external data source (OlympicDataLake) so you can copy-paste it into Synapse right after finishing this role assignment?

You said:
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'gold/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows; do i need to run this
ChatGPT said:
Yes ✅ exactly — that’s your first test query.

Here’s why:

It checks if your Synapse workspace managed identity (the one you just gave Storage Blob Data Reader role) can actually read your Delta table in ADLS.

It confirms that your external data source (OlympicDataLake) is working.

If it runs successfully, you’ll see the top 10 rows from your athletes_delta table in Synapse.

🔹 Steps to run it
In Synapse Studio → go to Develop (</>).

Click New SQL Script → Empty script.

Paste the query:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'gold/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
Hit Run (▶).

⚠️ But remember: before this works, you must have already created the external data source:

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS OlympicLake;
GO
USE OlympicLake;
GO

CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
👉 Did you already run the CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake step in Synapse, or should I walk you through creating that first before testing the OPENROWSET query?

You said:
Referenced external data source "OlympicDataLake" not found.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 7s
That error means the external data source hasn’t been created yet in Synapse. Do this once, then your OPENROWSET ... FORMAT='DELTA' query will work.

Create the external data source (serverless “Built-in”)
In Synapse Studio go to Develop (</>) → + → SQL script.
In the Connect to drop-down, pick Built-in.

Paste and run this, exactly as is (it uses your names):

-- Create DB if missing
IF DB_ID('OlympicLake') IS NULL
    CREATE DATABASE OlympicLake;
GO

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Use the workspace Managed Identity (you already granted Storage Blob Data Reader)
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sys.database_scoped_credentials WHERE name = 'SynapseManagedIdentity'
)
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

-- External data source to your ADLS container
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'OlympicDataLake'
)
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
Make sure the container name here is exactly your container: tokyo-olumpic-data (note the spelling), and the account is tokyoolympicdatajovan.

Test reading your Delta table
Now run:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'gold/athletes_delta/',               -- folder that contains _delta_log
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
If it still errors, check these quick fixes
In the script editor, Connect to = Built-in (serverless), not a dedicated pool.

Role assignment may take a couple minutes to propagate.

Path is relative to the container. Your full path would be
abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net/gold/athletes_delta/

The folder must contain _delta_log/ (your screenshot shows it ✅).

Storage account firewall: allow trusted Microsoft services (recommended).

Want me to generate the sql/01_create_external_objects.sql and sql/02_test_delta_query.sql files for your repo with these exact commands?

You said:

This is where the delta are written to transformed
ChatGPT said:
Perfect, thanks for showing me 👍

So your Delta tables live under:

Storage account → tokyoolympicdatajovan

Container → tokyo-olumpic-data

Folder → transformed-data/
(inside it you’ll have subfolders like athletes_delta/ with _delta_log/)

That means your paths for Synapse look like this:

abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net/transformed-data/athletes_delta/
🔹 Step 1 — Create External Data Source
In Synapse Studio (SQL Script editor, connect to Built-in):

-- Create DB if missing
IF DB_ID('OlympicLake') IS NULL
    CREATE DATABASE OlympicLake;
GO
USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Credential using Managed Identity
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.database_scoped_credentials WHERE name = 'SynapseManagedIdentity'
)
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

-- External data source
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'OlympicDataLake'
)
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
🔹 Step 2 — Test Reading a Delta Table
Try this query:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
If it works ✅ you’ll see 10 rows from your athletes_delta.

🔹 Step 3 — Repeat for other tables
Example for medals_delta:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/medals_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
⚠️ Important: your queries always need the container-relative path after BULK (so start with transformed-data/...).

👉 Do you want me to now generate ready-made .sql files for your GitHub repo (sql/01_create_external_objects.sql and sql/02_test_queries.sql) with your exact storage account and container names filled in?

You said:
-- Create DB if missing
IF DB_ID('OlympicLake') IS NULL
    CREATE DATABASE OlympicLake;
GO
USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Credential using Managed Identity
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.database_scoped_credentials WHERE name = 'SynapseManagedIdentity'
)
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

-- External data source
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'OlympicDataLake'
)
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO Where to run this 
ChatGPT said:
Great question 👍 You run this inside Synapse Studio using the Built-in (serverless) SQL pool.

Here’s the exact click-path for you:

🔹 Where to run the script
Go to your Synapse workspace → Open Synapse Studio (you’re already there in your screenshots ✅).

On the left sidebar, click Develop (</>).

At the top, click + → SQL script → Empty script.

In the editor that opens:

At the top of the script editor, you’ll see Connect to → choose Built-in (this is your serverless SQL pool).

Paste your script.

Click Run (▶ button).

🔹 Why “Built-in”
The “Built-in” serverless pool is free and lets you query data directly from ADLS.

You don’t need to create or pay for a dedicated SQL pool.

⚠️ If you try running it while connected to “master” or a dedicated pool, you’ll see errors like Referenced external data source not found. Always make sure Built-in is selected in the dropdown.

👉 Do you want me to show you how to check which database you’re in (master vs OlympicLake) before running the query, so you don’t get confused?

You said:

ChatGPT said:
Yes 👍 you’re in the right place, but I see the small issue in your screenshot:

At the top, you are connected to:
Connect to: Built-in ✅ (that’s correct)
Use database: master ❌

Your script is trying to CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE inside OlympicLake, but since you’re still in master, Synapse doesn’t know where to put it → that’s why you got the "Referenced external data source not found" error.

🔹 Fix
Run just the create database part first in master:

IF DB_ID('OlympicLake') IS NULL
    CREATE DATABASE OlympicLake;
GO
Now change the dropdown:

Top bar → Use database: OlympicLake (instead of master).

Then run the rest:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.database_scoped_credentials WHERE name = 'SynapseManagedIdentity'
)
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'OlympicDataLake'
)
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
🔹 Test Query
Once that succeeds, try:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
👉 So, in short:

master = where you create the database.

OlympicLake = where you create the external data source and run queries.

Do you want me to give you a step-by-step sequence of queries (with clear order: run in master first, then switch to OlympicLake) so you can just copy-paste without confusion?

You said:

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
You’re almost there! Right now you created the database but you’re still in master, so the external objects weren’t created. Do this exactly:

1) Create DB (in master) — you already did
IF DB_ID('OlympicLake') IS NULL
    CREATE DATABASE OlympicLake;
GO
2) Switch context to the new DB
In the top bar, click Use database: master → choose OlympicLake.

If it’s not in the list, click the little refresh icon next to the dropdown, then select OlympicLake.

(Keep “Connect to = Built-in”)

3) Create credential + external data source (run in OlympicLake)
Paste and run this as a new script (or below), making sure the dropdown now says Use database: OlympicLake:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sys.database_scoped_credentials WHERE name = 'SynapseManagedIdentity'
)
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'OlympicDataLake'
)
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
You already assigned Storage Blob Data Reader to the Synapse workspace MI, so this should succeed.

4) Test reading your Delta table
Run this (still in OlympicLake):

USE OlympicLake;
GO
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes_delta/',   -- folder that has _delta_log
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
If you still see “Referenced external data source not found”
Double-check the Use database dropdown says OlympicLake.

Re-run step 3 to create the data source in OlympicLake (external data sources are per-database).

Make sure the container/account names are exactly:

Container: tokyo-olumpic-data

Account: tokyoolympicdatajovan

Wait ~1–2 minutes in case RBAC is still propagating, then try again.

Want me to generate the two .sql files for your repo (01_create_external_objects.sql and 02_test_delta.sql) with these exact commands so you can commit them?

You said:
IF DB_ID('OlympicLake') IS NULL
    CREATE DATABASE OlympicLake;
GO but i asked you do i need t run this in master or?
ChatGPT said:
Exactly 👍 — that’s the key detail.

✅ Yes, you run the CREATE DATABASE OlympicLake; in master.
Because in Synapse (and SQL Server in general), new databases can only be created from the master context.

🔹 Sequence for you
In master (Built-in) → run only this part:

IF DB_ID('OlympicLake') IS NULL
    CREATE DATABASE OlympicLake;
GO
Refresh the Use database dropdown → switch to OlympicLake.

Now inside OlympicLake → run the rest:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
Finally test with your query:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
👉 So the rule is:

Create database → master

Everything else (credentials, data sources, views, queries) → inside OlympicLake

Would you like me to write this out as a step-by-step “run this first, then switch DB, then run this” script so you can just copy-paste without mistakes?

You said:
Uploaded image
Run this
ChatGPT said:
Yes ✅ this is exactly what you need to run now.

Why it’s correct:

Database context: top bar shows Use database = OlympicLake (good).

Credential: SynapseManagedIdentity → matches the role you assigned earlier.

External Data Source: OlympicDataLake → pointing to your ADLS container
(tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net).

🔹 Steps
Click Run (▶).

If successful, you’ll see a message like:
"Commands completed successfully" with no errors.

🔹 Next (Test Your Delta Table)
After it runs, create a new SQL script (still in OlympicLake) and paste:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
If this works ✅ you’ll see your Delta rows.

If it errors, we’ll double-check the folder path.

👉 Do you want me to also write you a re-usable sql/02_test_delta_query.sql file (with athletes + medals examples) so you can commit it into your GitHub repo?

That message means:

Synapse requires a Database Master Key (DMK) before you can create credentials.

It’s a standard security step — basically, a DMK encrypts the credentials inside the database.

👉 Do you want me to prepare a ready-made sql/01_create_external_objects.sql file for your GitHub repo that includes the CREATE MASTER KEY step too (so everything works out-of-the-box if someone else runs it)?

You said:
USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Create a Master Key (set your own strong password here)
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'YourStrongPassword123!';
GO do i need separate script or
ChatGPT said:
Good question 👍

You don’t need a separate script if you don’t want to — you can simply add the CREATE MASTER KEY command at the top of your OlympicLake setup script.

🔹 Two ways to handle it
Option 1: One combined script (simpler for you)
Put it all together like this:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Create Master Key (only needs to be done once per database)
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.symmetric_keys WHERE name = '##MS_DatabaseMasterKey##'
)
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'YourStrongPassword123!';
GO

-- Credential using Managed Identity
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.database_scoped_credentials WHERE name = 'SynapseManagedIdentity'
)
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

-- External Data Source
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'OlympicDataLake'
)
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
✅ Advantage: you can just run this once and it handles everything in order.

Option 2: Separate script (cleaner for GitHub repo)
01_create_master_key.sql → only has the master key

02_create_external_objects.sql → credential + external data source

This makes it easier for reviewers to understand each step.

👉 For your portfolio repo, I recommend Option 2 (separate scripts) because it’s more readable. But for quick setup in your own environment, Option 1 is fine.

Do you want me to write both 01_create_master_key.sql and 02_create_external_objects.sql files fully for you so you can just drop them into your sql/ folder?

You said:
create_master_key.sql what to add here
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👌 let’s make your create_master_key.sql clean and reusable for your repo.

Here’s what you should put inside:

📄 sql/01_create_master_key.sql
USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Create a Master Key in the database
-- This is required before creating any database scoped credentials
-- Replace the password with a strong one (min 8 chars, mix of upper/lower/numbers/symbols)
-- NOTE: You only need to run this once per database

IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.symmetric_keys WHERE name = '##MS_DatabaseMasterKey##'
)
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'YourStrongPassword123!';
GO
🔹 Notes
The IF NOT EXISTS check makes it safe — it won’t try to recreate the key if it already exists.

Replace 'YourStrongPassword123!' with your own strong password.

This script should be executed once in OlympicLake (not in master).

Next in Repo
01_create_master_key.sql → Master Key

02_create_external_objects.sql → Credential + External Data Source

03_test_delta_query.sql → Test queries against your Delta tables

👉 Do you want me to also write out the 02_create_external_objects.sql fully (so you have the next step ready for your repo)?

You said:
USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Create a Master Key in the database
-- This is required before creating any database scoped credentials
-- Replace the password with a strong one (min 8 chars, mix of upper/lower/numbers/symbols)
-- NOTE: You only need to run this once per database

IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.symmetric_keys WHERE name = '##MS_DatabaseMasterKey##'
)
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'YourStrongPassword123!';
GO I run this script without changeting the password can I rerun it or?
ChatGPT said:
Good catch 👍

Here’s what happens in your case:

You ran the script with 'YourStrongPassword123!' (the placeholder).

That means the Database Master Key (DMK) is now created with that exact password.

Once the DMK exists, you can’t run CREATE MASTER KEY again (you’ll get an error like "A master key already exists in the database") unless you drop it first.

🔹 Options you have
Leave it as-is ✅

Totally fine for a personal project.

The DMK password is only used if you back up/restore the key.

Synapse uses the key internally to encrypt your credentials, so as long as it exists, you’re good.

Change the password (if you really want)

You can rotate it with:

USE OlympicLake;
GO
ALTER MASTER KEY REGENERATE WITH ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'NewStrongerPassword!';
GO
This updates the password without dropping/recreating.

Drop and recreate (not usually needed)

Only if you want to completely reset things:

USE OlympicLake;
GO
DROP MASTER KEY;
GO
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'BetterPassword!';
GO
⚠️ But if you already had credentials depending on it, you’d need to recreate them too.

✅ Recommendation:
Since this is your portfolio / demo project → just leave it. No problem that you used 'YourStrongPassword123!'. It won’t affect querying your Delta tables.

👉 Do you want me to give you the next script (02_create_external_objects.sql) so you can continue right away with creating your external data source?

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 let’s move to the next script for your repo:

📄 sql/02_create_external_objects.sql
USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Create a database scoped credential using the Synapse Managed Identity
-- This requires that the Synapse workspace Managed Identity has
-- "Storage Blob Data Reader" role on the storage account.
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.database_scoped_credentials WHERE name = 'SynapseManagedIdentity'
)
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY = 'Managed Identity';
GO

-- Create an external data source pointing to the ADLS Gen2 container
-- Update LOCATION if your container or account name changes
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'OlympicDataLake'
)
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
    LOCATION   = 'abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
    CREDENTIAL = SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
🔹 Notes
This script must be run after 01_create_master_key.sql.

It will create:

SynapseManagedIdentity → credential that uses the Synapse workspace’s managed identity.

OlympicDataLake → external data source pointing to your ADLS container.

You already granted the Synapse workspace access (Storage Blob Data Reader) — so once this runs, you can query your Delta tables.

🔹 Next step (after this)
Create sql/03_test_delta_query.sql with test queries like:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Test reading Athletes Delta table
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;

-- Test reading Medals Delta table
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/medals_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
👉 Do you want me to prepare this 03_test_delta_query.sql fully for you so you can just drop it into your repo and run it as the final test?

Yes 🎉 exactly like that — you did it right:

✅ Connected to Built-in (serverless SQL pool)

✅ Database = OlympicLake

✅ Script includes both:

SynapseManagedIdentity (credential)

OlympicDataLake (external data source)

✅ Correct LOCATION → abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net

🔹 Next Step: Test Delta Table
Now create a new SQL script (still in OlympicLake) and paste:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Test Athletes Delta table
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;

-- Test Medals Delta table
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/medals_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
Run it → you should see data from your Delta folders. 🚀

👉 Do you want me to prepare this as a clean file sql/03_test_delta_query.sql for your GitHub repo (so your project has a neat step-by-step SQL folder)?

Total execution time: 00:00:00.908
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 21s
Great—your setup is almost complete.
That error:

“Content of directory … cannot be listed.”

means Synapse can reach the storage account but doesn’t have data-plane permission to list/read the ADLS Gen2 paths. RBAC (Storage Blob Data Reader) is not enough for ABFS/OAuth access; you also need POSIX ACLs on the container/folders (and in some cases a networking allow).

Do these 3 quick fixes:

1) Give Synapse MI POSIX ACLs on the container & folders
You must add your Synapse workspace managed identity (e.g., tokyo-olympic-sn) to the ACLs of the container and the folders.

In Azure Portal
Storage account → Containers → open tokyo-olumpic-data.

Click the … next to the container name (or open transformed-data) → look for “Manage ACLs / Access control (Data Lake)” (sometimes under “More”).

Add entry for the security principal tokyo-olympic-sn (Synapse workspace).

Grant:

On container root (/ of the container): r-x (Read + Execute) as Access ACL and also set Default ACL r-x so new folders inherit.

On transformed-data and on each Delta table folder (e.g., athletes_delta, medals_delta): r-x (Access ACL).

Propagate to “This folder, subfolders and files.”

Minimum needed: Execute on every parent directory to traverse, Read on the directory to list, and Read on files to read them.

Tip: It’s easiest to do this with Azure Storage Explorer (desktop) where the “Manage Access…” dialog lets you apply recursively to subfolders/files.

2) Networking check (if you locked the storage account)
If your Storage account → Networking is restricted:

Either temporarily set “Enabled from all networks”, or

Keep Selected networks but enable: “Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account.”

This lets Synapse serverless reach the account.

3) Retry the query
Back in Synapse (Built-in, DB = OlympicLake):

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
If ACLs + networking are correct, you’ll get rows. If it still fails:

Recheck that the path is container-relative (transformed-data/athletes_delta/) and the folder contains _delta_log/ (yours does ✅).

Confirm the principal you added in ACLs is exactly the Synapse workspace managed identity (not your user).

As a fallback, you can create a /serve/ Parquet snapshot from Databricks and query with FORMAT='PARQUET'—but Delta should work once ACLs are set.

Want a 1-minute walkthrough with screenshots on where the “Manage ACLs” button is in the portal and the exact checkboxes to tick?

You said:
Yes I need to know where to start
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 let’s go step by step so you can fix this “cannot be listed” error.

Right now, Synapse’s Managed Identity has RBAC permissions (Storage Blob Data Reader) but not POSIX ACLs on your container and folders. For ADLS Gen2, Synapse needs both.

🔹 Step 1 — Go to your container in Azure Portal
Open Azure Portal.

Search for your Storage Account: tokyoolympicdatajovan.

On the left menu, click Containers.

Click your container: tokyo-olumpic-data.

👉 You’re already familiar with this screen (the one in your screenshot showing raw-data/, transformed-data/). Stay there.

🔹 Step 2 — Open Access Control (Data Lake ACLs)
Inside the container, at the top bar, click “Access Control (IAM)” → that’s RBAC (you already did this).

For ACLs, you need to switch to “Change Access Control (Preview)” or “Manage ACLs”.

⚠️ The button depends on Azure Portal version:

Sometimes it’s on the top menu bar → “Manage ACLs”.

Sometimes you have to click the folder (transformed-data) → ... (three dots) → Access Control (IAM) → Manage ACLs.

If you don’t see it easily:
👉 It’s not IAM but Access Control (Data Lake Gen2).

🔹 Step 3 — Add Synapse Workspace Managed Identity
In the ACL editor, click Add principal.

Search for your Synapse workspace: tokyo-olympic-sn.

Select it.

🔹 Step 4 — Grant minimum permissions
For Synapse to list and read:

On tokyo-olumpic-data (container root) → give Execute (x) and Read (r).

On transformed-data → give Execute (x) and Read (r).

On each table folder (e.g., athletes_delta/, medals_delta/) → give Execute (x) and Read (r).

👉 In the portal you’ll see checkboxes for Read, Write, Execute. Tick Read + Execute.

⚠️ Also tick “Default ACL” so any new files/folders inherit these permissions.

🔹 Step 5 — Save changes
Click Save or Apply in the ACL editor.

🔹 Step 6 — Re-run Synapse query
Now go back to Synapse Studio and test again:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes_delta/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
If ACLs were applied correctly, you should now see rows instead of the “cannot be listed” error 🚀.

👉 Do you want me to show you how to do this with Azure Storage Explorer instead of Portal? (It’s often much easier to see the ACLs and apply recursively to all subfolders).

Where to go from here
ChatGPT said:
Great, thanks for showing me — right now you’re in Access Control (IAM), which is RBAC. That part you already did (Storage Blob Data Reader ✅).

But for ADLS Gen2, Synapse also needs Access Control Lists (ACLs) at the container and folder level. This is a different menu than IAM.

🔹 How to find ACLs in Azure Portal
Stay inside your container view (tokyo-olumpic-data).

In your earlier screenshot (where you saw raw-data/, transformed-data/), you were in the right place.

Click on the folder you want to give access to (e.g., transformed-data).

At the top, instead of IAM, look for a menu called:

“Access Control (Data Lake Gen2)”

or “Manage ACLs”

or sometimes just “Change Access Control (Preview)”.

This will open the ACL editor with checkboxes Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x).

Add your Synapse Workspace Managed Identity (tokyo-olympic-sn) and give it:

Container root (tokyo-olumpic-data) → Read (r) + Execute (x)

transformed-data/ → Read (r) + Execute (x)

athletes_delta/, medals_delta/ → Read (r) + Execute (x)

⚠️ Don’t forget: enable Default ACLs so subfolders inherit.

🔹 Easier option (recommended)
Azure Portal sometimes hides this ACL editor. The easiest way is with Azure Storage Explorer (free app from Microsoft). There you can:

Right-click container/folder → Manage Access Control Lists (ACLs).

Add Synapse MI → tick r-x.

Apply recursively.

👉 Do you want me to guide you step by step in Storage Explorer (download, connect, set ACLs recursively) since that’s usually much faster than hunting for the hidden ACL menu in Portal?

Where
ChatGPT said:
Perfect, now I see you’re inside your transformed-data folder in the container. 👍
This is the right place — now we need to assign ACLs (Access Control Lists) so Synapse can traverse and read.

🔹 In Azure Portal
Hover over one of the folders (e.g. athletes) → click the ... (three dots) menu on the right.

In that menu, you should see “Manage Access Control (ACLs)” or “Access Control (Data Lake Gen2)”.

If you don’t see it, click into the folder, and at the top you may see “Access Control (IAM)” and “Change Access Control (Preview)”.

Open that option.

🔹 Add Synapse Workspace Identity
In the ACL editor → Add principal → search for your Synapse workspace (tokyo-olympic-sn).

Check Read (r) and Execute (x).

Read = can read/list contents.

Execute = can traverse into the folder.

Make sure to apply:

Access ACL (current folder access).

Default ACL (so subfolders/files inherit permissions).

🔹 Apply ACLs Recursively
Do this at least on:

Container root: tokyo-olumpic-data

transformed-data

Each dataset folder (athletes, medals, etc.).

This ensures Synapse can list _delta_log inside each.

✅ After this, re-run your query in Synapse:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
👉 Do you want me to show you the Storage Explorer way instead? (Right-click → “Manage Access Control Lists (ACLs)” → add Synapse MI once and apply recursively to all subfolders in one click.) It’s much easier than doing each folder manually in the Portal.

You said:

Here
ChatGPT said:
Yes! ✅ You’ve opened the right place — this is the Manage ACL screen for /transformed-data/athletes.

Now you just need to add your Synapse workspace managed identity here (tokyo-olympic-sn).

🔹 Steps to do next
Click + Add principal.

In the search box, type:

tokyo-olympic-sn
(that’s your Synapse Analytics workspace name).

Select it.

Grant permissions:

Read (r) ✔

Execute (x) ✔
(leave Write unchecked).

Do this on:

Container root (tokyo-olumpic-data)

transformed-data

Each subfolder where you store Delta (athletes, medals, etc.)

⚠️ Important:
Switch to the Default permissions tab in the same screen → add the same principal with r + x so all new files inside also inherit permissions.

🔹 After saving
Go back to Synapse Studio and rerun:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
If ACLs are set correctly, you should now get rows 🎉.

👉 Do you want me to also give you the exact step-by-step for doing this once at the container root and propagating down (so you don’t need to repeat for every folder)?

You said:

ChatGPT said:
Yes 🎉 that’s exactly what you needed — you’ve added your Synapse workspace tokyo-olympic-sn and given it Read + Execute ✅.

But notice the warning at the bottom:

“Read and write permissions will only work … if the security principal also has execute permissions on all parent directories, including the container (root).”

That means:

You gave access at /transformed-data/athletes.

But Synapse also needs Execute (x) at every parent:

Container root /tokyo-olumpic-data

/transformed-data

Without those, Synapse can’t even traverse into athletes/.

🔹 What to do next
Go back one level (to /transformed-data).

Open Manage ACL there.

Add tokyo-olympic-sn with Execute (x) and Read (r).

Go back to the container root (/tokyo-olumpic-data).

Open Manage ACL.

Add tokyo-olympic-sn with at least Execute (x) (you can also tick Read (r)).

(Optional but recommended) On each dataset folder (athletes, medals, etc.), also ensure tokyo-olympic-sn has Read + Execute.

Switch to the Default permissions tab at each level, and also add tokyo-olympic-sn with r+x so new files automatically inherit permissions.

🔹 After this
Re-run your Synapse query:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
It should now return rows 🚀.

👉 Do you want me to give you the minimal ACL matrix (exact checkboxes at container, folder, subfolder levels) so you can apply once and not worry about missing any?

You said:

Here
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 you’re now at the transformed-data folder level.

Now you need to repeat what you did for /athletes, but here at /transformed-data.

🔹 What to do
Click the ... (three dots) on the right side of transformed-data.

Choose Manage ACL (or Access control for Data Lake).

In the ACL editor:

Add tokyo-olympic-sn (if not already there).

Tick Read (r) and Execute (x).

Leave Write unchecked.

Save.

⚠️ After that, you must also do the same one more level up (the container root /tokyo-olumpic-data).

🔹 Why
That warning you saw before is telling you: Synapse can only “walk down” the directory tree if it has Execute on every parent folder.

So the minimum needed for Synapse workspace MI is:

Container root /tokyo-olumpic-data → Execute (x)

transformed-data → Read (r) + Execute (x)

Each table folder (athletes, medals, etc.) → Read (r) + Execute (x)

👉 Do you want me to draw you a small matrix of the exact ACL permissions per level so you can just follow it like a checklist?

You said:
tokyo-olumpic-data can i do it directly here
ChatGPT said:
Yes ✅ — you can (and should) also do it directly at the container root (tokyo-olumpic-data).

That way, Synapse will have the execute (x) permission it needs at the top level, and you won’t hit the “cannot be listed” error when it tries to traverse down into transformed-data and then into athletes_delta or medals_delta.

🔹 Steps
Go to your container view → select tokyo-olumpic-data (root container).

Click the ... (three dots) → Manage ACL.

Add your Synapse workspace tokyo-olympic-sn (if not already present).

Grant:

Execute (x) ✔ (required for traversal)

Read (r) ✔ (optional but recommended so it can list contents)

Write (w) ❌ (don’t check this).

Save.

Switch to the Default permissions tab → also add tokyo-olympic-sn with r+x, so that new folders you create under this container automatically inherit access.

🔹 Checklist of minimal ACLs
Level	Principal	Read (r)	Write (w)	Execute (x)
/tokyo-olumpic-data	tokyo-olympic-sn	✔		✔
/transformed-data	tokyo-olympic-sn	✔		✔
/athletes_delta	tokyo-olympic-sn	✔		✔
/medals_delta	tokyo-olympic-sn	✔		✔
other delta folders	tokyo-olympic-sn	✔		✔
👉 Once you set ACLs at the container and at transformed-data, try re-running your Synapse query.
If it still fails, you may only need to adjust the delta folder ACLs.

Do you want me to also show you how to apply these ACLs recursively in one go (so you don’t need to click each folder manually)?

You said:

ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👌 — now you’ve added tokyo-olympic-sn at the container root (tokyo-olumpic-data).

You gave it:

Read (r) ✔

Execute (x) ✔

Write (w) ❌ (good, you don’t need it).

This is exactly what Synapse needs at the container root so it can “walk down” into subfolders.

🔹 Next step
Make sure you also set Default permissions here at the container root.

Switch to the Default permissions tab.

Add tokyo-olympic-sn again with r+x.

That way, all new folders (like future Delta tables) inherit access automatically.

Double-check /transformed-data ACLs:

tokyo-olympic-sn should have r+x there too.

Double-check each dataset folder (e.g. /athletes, /medals).

Again, tokyo-olympic-sn needs r+x.

🔹 After you confirm
Go back to Synapse and re-run:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
👉 With container root + transformed-data + athletes all having Execute, Synapse will finally be able to traverse and list the _delta_log.

⚡ Do you want me to give you the exact 3 places where you must have r+x for Synapse to succeed, so you can just tick them off as a checklist?

Read and write permissions will only work for a security principal if the security principal also has execute permissions on all parent directories, including the container (root directory). It does not matter if I still get this
ChatGPT said:
That red banner is just a reminder. It will always show until the principal has Execute (x) on every parent folder. If you’ve added r+x to:

the container root /tokyo-olumpic-data ✅

the folder /transformed-data ✅

the dataset folder itself (e.g., /transformed-data/athletes) ✅

…you can ignore the warning and test your query.

Quick checklist (tick these off)
 tokyo-olympic-sn has Execute (x) at container root

 tokyo-olympic-sn has Read (r) + Execute (x) at /transformed-data

 tokyo-olympic-sn has Read (r) + Execute (x) at each table folder (athletes, medals, …)

 (Recommended) Add the same r+x under Default permissions at root and /transformed-data so new files inherit

Important: use the actual folder names in your query
Your latest screenshot shows folders named athletes, medals, coaches, etc. (not *_delta). So query those:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Athletes
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
GO

-- Medals
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/medals/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
GO
If it still errors
Recheck Execute (x) exists at root and /transformed-data (parents must have x).

Make sure you added the Synapse workspace managed identity (not your user).

Confirm the folder contains a _delta_log/ (open the folder and check).

Synapse script is connected to Built-in and Use database = OlympicLake.

Storage account Networking → allow Trusted Microsoft services (or all networks while testing).

Once those are set, the “cannot be listed” error goes away and the query will return rows.

You said:
tokyo-olumpic-data I  added to this only
ChatGPT said:
Gotcha — adding ACLs only at the container root isn’t enough.
Synapse also needs Execute (x) on every parent folder all the way down to the table folder, plus Read (r) on the folders it must list.

Do this (Azure Portal)
/tokyo-olumpic-data/transformed-data

Click the three dots … next to transformed-data → Manage ACL (or Access control for Data Lake).

Add principal: tokyo-olympic-sn

Check Read and Execute → Save.

Go to Default permissions tab → add tokyo-olympic-sn with Read + Execute → Save.

Each dataset folder inside transformed-data

For athletes, medals, coaches, entriesgender, teams:

Open the folder → … → Manage ACL

Add tokyo-olympic-sn with Read + Execute → Save.

(Optional but good) In Default permissions, add Read + Execute → Save.

If the portal doesn’t let you apply recursively, repeat for each folder.
Faster alternative: use Azure Storage Explorer → right-click folder → Manage Access Control Lists (ACLs) → add tokyo-olympic-sn (r+x) → Apply to this folder, subfolders and files.

Then test in Synapse (Built-in, DB = OlympicLake)

Quick checklist
 Root /tokyo-olumpic-data: r + x for tokyo-olympic-sn

 /transformed-data: r + x for tokyo-olympic-sn (also in Default)

 Every table folder (athletes, medals, coaches, entriesgender, teams): r + x (and optionally Default)

Once those three levels have r+x, the “cannot be listed” error should disappear.

You said:
I do not understand do I need to add to all of them or just the root the container
ChatGPT said:
Great question 👍 Let’s make this super clear.

For Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, permissions are hierarchical:

To open /tokyo-olumpic-data/transformed-data/athletes/_delta_log, Synapse must “walk” through every parent folder.

That means it needs Execute (x) at all levels (root, intermediate, and target folder).

So:

Minimum ACLs needed for Synapse (tokyo-olympic-sn)
Root container (/tokyo-olumpic-data)

✅ Execute (x)

(optional but good: Read (r) so it can list the container)

Intermediate folder (/transformed-data)

✅ Execute (x)

✅ Read (r) so it can list the contents (athletes, medals, …)

Target dataset folders (/athletes, /medals, /coaches, …)

✅ Execute (x)

✅ Read (r) so it can open and read Delta files

🔑 Shortcut
If you only set permissions at the root → Synapse can’t automatically read child folders.
You must grant at least r+x on the root, r+x on transformed-data, and r+x on each dataset folder.

⚡ Best practice:
Use Azure Storage Explorer → right-click the container → Manage ACLs → add tokyo-olympic-sn with r+x → apply recursively to all subfolders and files.
👉 That way you don’t have to set each one manually.

✅ Answer: You must give permissions at all levels (root + transformed-data + dataset folders). Just the root is not enough.

Do you want me to show you exactly how to do the recursive apply with Storage Explorer, so you can fix this in one shot instead of clicking each folder in the portal?

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 Using Azure Storage Explorer is the fastest way — you can apply ACLs recursively in one shot instead of doing root + every folder manually.

🔹 Step 1 — Install & Open
Download Azure Storage Explorer (free).

Install and open it.

Sign in with the same Azure account that owns your subscription.

🔹 Step 2 — Navigate to Your Container
In the left panel → expand Storage Accounts.

Find your account: tokyoolympicdatajovan.

Expand → Blob Containers → select tokyo-olumpic-data.

Inside, you’ll see raw-data, transformed-data, etc.

🔹 Step 3 — Manage ACLs
Right-click tokyo-olumpic-data → select Manage Access Control Lists (ACLs).

(You can also do this on transformed-data, but starting at the container root is better.)

In the ACL editor:

Click Add → search for your Synapse workspace managed identity (tokyo-olympic-sn).

Grant Read (r) and Execute (x) ✔.

Leave Write (w) ❌.

🔹 Step 4 — Apply Recursively
At the bottom, check “Apply changes recursively”.

Choose “This folder, subfolders, and files”.

Apply.

This will push r+x for tokyo-olympic-sn to:

Root container

transformed-data

Every dataset folder (athletes, medals, …)

All Delta files inside

🔹 Step 5 — Test in Synapse
Back in Synapse Studio, run:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Test Athletes Delta
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
GO
If ACLs applied recursively → Synapse should now return rows 🎉.

👉 Do you want me to also give you the exact permissions matrix (what Synapse MI should have at root, folders, files) so you can double-check after applying in Storage Explorer?

You said:
Blob Containers you mean containers only
ChatGPT said:
Exactly 👍 — in Azure Storage Explorer, the left-hand tree shows:

Storage Accounts

your account → tokyoolympicdatajovan

Blob Containers (this is where your ADLS Gen2 containers live)

Inside Blob Containers, you’ll see your container:
👉 tokyo-olumpic-data

That’s the same one you’ve been working with in the Azure Portal under “Containers.”

✅ Steps Recap for you in Storage Explorer
Expand Storage Accounts → tokyoolympicdatajovan → Blob Containers

Right-click your container → Manage Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Add principal tokyo-olympic-sn → check Read (r) + Execute (x)

Apply recursively → “This folder, subfolders, and files”

⚡ That way you don’t need to set ACLs one by one on root, transformed-data, athletes, etc. Storage Explorer will push the permissions everywhere in one go.

👉 Do you want me to draw you a little before/after tree view of your container showing how ACLs should look after you apply them recursively?

You said:

Here?
ChatGPT said:
Ah — I see 👍 That screenshot is from the Azure Portal, not from Azure Storage Explorer.

In the Portal, you’ll only see Containers (like you showed).

In Storage Explorer (the desktop app), it looks different: you’ll see a tree like this:

Storage Accounts
   └── tokyoolympicdatajovan
         └── Blob Containers
                └── tokyo-olumpic-data
                       ├── raw-data
                       └── transformed-data
                             ├── athletes
                             ├── medals
                             ├── coaches
                             └── teams
That’s where you right-click → Manage Access Control Lists (ACLs) → apply recursively.

✅ If you only want to stay in the Azure Portal, you’ll need to repeat the Manage ACL step at:

Root container (tokyo-olumpic-data)

transformed-data

Each dataset folder (athletes, medals, …)

⚡ If you use Azure Storage Explorer, you can set it once at the container root and check Apply recursively → subfolders and files. Much faster.

👉 Do you already have Azure Storage Explorer installed? If not, I can walk you step by step to download, sign in, and find your container there.

You said:
Azure Storage Explorer no
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 — since you don’t have Azure Storage Explorer, let’s stick with the Azure Portal.
That just means you’ll need to set ACLs in a few places manually.

✅ What you need to do in the Portal
Repeat Manage ACL → Add principal (tokyo-olympic-sn) → r+x in these 3 places:

Root container:

/tokyo-olumpic-data

Already done ✔

Intermediate folder:

/tokyo-olumpic-data/transformed-data

Add Synapse MI with Read + Execute

Target dataset folders:

/tokyo-olumpic-data/transformed-data/athletes

/tokyo-olumpic-data/transformed-data/medals

/tokyo-olumpic-data/transformed-data/coaches

/tokyo-olumpic-data/transformed-data/entriesgender

/tokyo-olumpic-data/transformed-data/teams

Add Synapse MI with Read + Execute

⚠️ Important: In each screen, also check the Default permissions tab → add tokyo-olympic-sn with r+x so any new files inherit the right permissions.

✅ After you finish
Go back to Synapse Studio and test again:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
If ACLs are correct at root + transformed-data + dataset folder → Synapse will finally be able to read _delta_log.

👉 Do you want me to give you a step-by-step with screenshots from the portal menus (root → transformed-data → athletes), so you can just follow exactly where to click?

You said:
Root container:

/tokyo-olumpic-data

Already done ✔ read and execure or?

ChatGPT said:
Exactly ✅

At the root container (/tokyo-olumpic-data) you only need to give your Synapse workspace managed identity (tokyo-olympic-sn) these permissions:

Execute (x) → required so Synapse can traverse into child folders.

Read (r) → optional but recommended, so Synapse can also list the folders inside the container.

Write (w) → ❌ not needed.

So the correct setting at the root is:

Principal	Read (r)	Write (w)	Execute (x)
tokyo-olympic-sn	✔		✔
🔹 Now you must also repeat the same (r+x) for:

/transformed-data

each dataset folder (athletes, medals, coaches, entriesgender, teams).

That way Synapse can traverse the path step by step until it reaches the _delta_log.

👉 Do you want me to give you the order in which to apply these so you don’t miss a level?

You said:
Uploaded image
Here for root
ChatGPT said:
Yes ✅ this looks correct for the root container (/tokyo-olumpic-data):

For your Synapse workspace identity (tokyo-olympic-sn), you’ve set:

Read (r) ✔

Execute (x) ✔

Write (w) ❌ (left unchecked, which is correct)

That means Synapse can now see into the container and traverse deeper.

🔹 Next steps
You need to repeat this for:

/tokyo-olumpic-data/transformed-data → give tokyo-olympic-sn r+x

Each dataset folder inside /transformed-data (athletes, medals, coaches, entriesgender, teams) → give tokyo-olympic-sn r+x

⚡ Tip: On each screen, also check the Default permissions tab and give tokyo-olympic-sn r+x there too. That way, any new files/folders automatically inherit access.

👉 Do you want me to write out the exact sequence of clicks in the Portal for /transformed-data next, so you can do it without confusion?

You said:
I have done it
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👏 — nice work!

Now that you’ve given your Synapse workspace managed identity (tokyo-olympic-sn) Read + Execute at:

Root container /tokyo-olumpic-data

/transformed-data

Each dataset folder (athletes, medals, coaches, entriesgender, teams)

…Synapse should finally be able to traverse into the _delta_log and read the Delta tables. 🎉

✅ Next test in Synapse Studio
In your OlympicLake database, run something like:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Test Athletes Delta table
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
GO

-- Test Medals Delta table
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/medals/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
GO
🔹 If it works
You’ll see rows returned 🎉. Then you can create external tables or views in Synapse for Power BI to connect.

🔹 If it still fails
Double-check you’re connected to the OlympicLake database (not master).

Make sure you typed the folder names exactly (athletes, not athletes_delta).

Verify that each dataset folder has a _delta_log/ (that confirms it’s a Delta table).

👉 Do you want me to give you the SQL scripts to create external tables in Synapse for each dataset (athletes, medals, etc.), so you don’t have to query with OPENROWSET every time?

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 8s
You’re still querying the wrong folder.
The error path shows:

.../transformed-data/athletes_delta/_delta_log/*.*
But your container screenshot shows the folders are named:

transformed-data/
  athletes
  medals
  coaches
  entriesgender
  teams
(i.e., no _delta suffix). Query the actual Delta table folders.

Run this instead (exactly):
USE OlympicLake;
GO

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',   -- <== note: athletes, not athletes_delta
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
GO

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'transformed-data/medals/',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
    FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
GO
If it still fails
Open the athletes folder in the portal and confirm it contains a _delta_log/ directory. If it doesn’t, that folder isn’t a Delta table—rewrite it from Databricks as Delta.

Double-check ACLs (r+x) for tokyo-olympic-sn at:

container root /tokyo-olumpic-data

/transformed-data

/transformed-data/athletes

Make sure you’re connected to Built-in and Use database = OlympicLake.

But most likely, switching the path to athletes/ (not athletes_delta/) will fix it.

You said:
It says retriving query result
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11s
Nice — that “Retrieving query result” message usually appears right after you fixed the path/ACLs and Synapse is scanning the Delta metadata.

Do these quick checks to make sure it completes cleanly:

Make sure the script is exactly this (no _delta in the path):

USE OlympicLake;
GO

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
Top bar: Connect to = Built-in and Use database = OlympicLake.

If the spinner sits there without finishing: hit Cancel (⏹️) and Run again once. Synapse serverless sometimes needs a fresh execution after new ACLs.

If it errors, share the exact error text and we’ll fix it fast. Common culprits:

Folder name typo (must be athletes/, medals/, etc.).

Missing _delta_log/ inside the folder (then it isn’t a Delta table yet).

ACLs missing Execute on a parent folder (root or transformed-data).

Once the query returns, we’ll create views so you don’t have to type OPENROWSET each time.

You said:
It executed successfully you are life saviour thank you
ChatGPT said:
🎉🔥 That’s amazing news — well done! You just connected Synapse to your Delta Lake tables — this is one of the trickiest steps in a lakehouse project, so you crushed it 👏

Now you’ve got Synapse reading the data, the next steps are usually:

✅ 1. Create External Tables or Views
So you don’t need to use OPENROWSET every time:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

CREATE VIEW vw_Athletes AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
GO

CREATE VIEW vw_Medals AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/medals/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
GO
Now you can just run:

SELECT TOP 10 * FROM vw_Athletes;
✅ 2. Hook Up to Power BI
In Power BI Desktop → Get Data → Azure Synapse Analytics (SQL)

Enter your Synapse workspace name → pick OlympicLake database

Your views (vw_Athletes, vw_Medals, etc.) will show like normal tables

Build dashboards 🏅 (medals per country, gender distribution, athlete counts, etc.)

✅ 3. Project Repo Structure
Since you’re building this for GitHub:

ChatGPT said:
Yes ✅ — you can (and should) keep all of this in one script.

That way when you or someone else sets up the project, they just:

Connect to OlympicLake database in Synapse Studio

Run 04_create_views.sql once

All base views (vw_Athletes, vw_Medals, etc.) and convenience analytics views (vw_MedalTallyByCountry, vw_GenderDistribution, …) get created in one go.

📄 Suggested repo organization for sql/
sql/
  01_create_master_key.sql
  02_create_external_objects.sql
  03_test_delta_query.sql
  04_create_views.sql   <-- your big script above
👉 The script you pasted is already ready to go — you can save it as 04_create_views.sql.
Then, in Synapse Studio → Develop (</>) → New SQL Script → connect to Built-in → OlympicLake → paste everything and Run All.

Would you like me to also prepare a README.md snippet just for the sql/ folder (explaining what each script does), so your repo looks extra polished for recruiters?

You said:
mismatched input 'VIEW' expecting {'PROC', 'PROCEDURE'}
ChatGPT said:
Ah 👍 that error usually means you accidentally ran the script while connected to the wrong database context.

In Synapse serverless SQL:

If you’re still in master → CREATE VIEW isn’t allowed → you’ll get:

mismatched input 'VIEW' expecting {'PROC', 'PROCEDURE'}
If you’re in your own DB (OlympicLake) → CREATE VIEW works fine.

✅ Fix
In Synapse Studio → top bar:

Connect to = Built-in

Use database = OlympicLake (not master)

Then re-run your script:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

CREATE OR ALTER VIEW dbo.vw_Athletes AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS src;
GO
This time it should succeed.

⚡ Quick tip:
If you often forget to switch, add this line at the very top of your scripts so it forces the right context:

USE OlympicLake;
GO
👉 Do you want me to give you a step-by-step “click path” in Synapse Studio (with screenshots style description) showing exactly where to switch from master to OlympicLake before running?

You’re in the right DB ✅. The error is most likely because serverless SQL doesn’t support CREATE OR ALTER VIEW in its T-SQL dialect. Use DROP VIEW IF EXISTS …; CREATE VIEW … instead.

Tips
Make sure the top bar shows Connect to: Built-in and Use database: OlympicLake before you run.

If you still get a generic “completed with errors”, scroll the Messages pane to see which batch failed. It’s often a typo in the folder name (e.g., entriesgender must match exactly).

If you want stricter schemas (better for Power BI), we can replace the SELECT * with explicit column definitions via WITH ( ... ) inside each OPENROWSET.

Want me to generate a version with explicit column types based on your Databricks tables?

Invalid column name 'Medal'.
Total execution time: 00:00:05.444
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 17s
Great progress! The error explains itself:

Invalid column name 'Medal'.

Your vw_Medals view doesn’t have a column named Medal. That usually means your Medals table is the aggregated country totals file (columns like Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total, and Country/NOC) rather than a per-event/per-athlete table with a Medal column.

Quick check (run these to see the schema)
-- What columns exist on the view?
SELECT COLUMN_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'vw_Medals'
ORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION;

-- Peek a few rows
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Medals;
Fix: create a medal tally view that matches an aggregated schema
Use one of the two versions below, depending on which country field you actually have:

If your columns are Country, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.vw_MedalTallyByCountry','V') IS NOT NULL DROP VIEW dbo.vw_MedalTallyByCountry;
GO
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_MedalTallyByCountry AS
SELECT
  Country,
  SUM(CAST(Gold   AS BIGINT))  AS Gold,
  SUM(CAST(Silver AS BIGINT))  AS Silver,
  SUM(CAST(Bronze AS BIGINT))  AS Bronze,
  SUM(CAST(Total  AS BIGINT))  AS TotalMedals
FROM dbo.vw_Medals
GROUP BY Country;
GO
If your columns are NOC, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.vw_MedalTallyByCountry','V') IS NOT NULL DROP VIEW dbo.vw_MedalTallyByCountry;
GO
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_MedalTallyByCountry AS
SELECT
  NOC AS Country,
  SUM(CAST(Gold   AS BIGINT))  AS Gold,
  SUM(CAST(Silver AS BIGINT))  AS Silver,
  SUM(CAST(Bronze AS BIGINT))  AS Bronze,
  SUM(CAST(Total  AS BIGINT))  AS TotalMedals
FROM dbo.vw_Medals
GROUP BY NOC;
GO
If your transformed columns still have spaces or special chars (e.g., Team/NOC, Rank by Total), you must quote them with brackets: [Team/NOC], [Rank by Total]. But since these are transformed Delta tables, you likely already cleaned names.

What about the other analytics views?
vw_GenderDistribution (from vw_Athletes) should work if Gender exists.

vw_AthletesByTeam should use whatever your team field is (NOC, Country, or Team). Adjust the column in the GROUP BY.

If you paste me the column list returned by the schema check above, I’ll tailor the exact CREATE VIEW statements to your real column names so you can just run them without changes.

Perfect—thanks for the column list. Your Medals table is aggregated by country with columns:

Rank, TeamCountry, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total, RankByTotal, medal_points, rank_by_gold, rank_by_total, ingestion_date, source_file

That means the analytics views must use TeamCountry and Total (not a Medal column). Drop/recreate the analytics views with the script below.

Fix the analytics views
Run this (Built-in, database = OlympicLake):

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- 1) Medal tally by country (sums Gold/Silver/Bronze/Total)
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.vw_MedalTallyByCountry','V') IS NOT NULL DROP VIEW dbo.vw_MedalTallyByCountry;
GO
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_MedalTallyByCountry AS
SELECT
  TeamCountry,
  SUM(TRY_CAST(Gold   AS BIGINT))   AS Gold,
  SUM(TRY_CAST(Silver AS BIGINT))   AS Silver,
  SUM(TRY_CAST(Bronze AS BIGINT))   AS Bronze,
  SUM(TRY_CAST(Total  AS BIGINT))   AS TotalMedals
FROM dbo.vw_Medals
GROUP BY TeamCountry;
GO

-- 2) Top 20 countries by total medals
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.vw_Top20CountriesByMedals','V') IS NOT NULL DROP VIEW dbo.vw_Top20CountriesByMedals;
GO
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_Top20CountriesByMedals AS
SELECT TOP 20
  TeamCountry AS Country,
  SUM(TRY_CAST(Total AS BIGINT)) AS TotalMedals
FROM dbo.vw_Medals
GROUP BY TeamCountry
ORDER BY TotalMedals DESC;
GO
Keep/adjust the other views
vw_GenderDistribution (from vw_Athletes) will work if your athletes dataset has a Gender column.

vw_AthletesByTeam currently groups by NOC. If your athletes table uses a different field (e.g., TeamCountry), change it accordingly:

-- If athletes have NOC:
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.vw_AthletesByTeam','V') IS NOT NULL DROP VIEW dbo.vw_AthletesByTeam;
GO
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_AthletesByTeam AS
SELECT NOC AS TeamCode, COUNT(*) AS AthleteCount
FROM dbo.vw_Athletes
GROUP BY NOC;
GO

-- If athletes use TeamCountry instead, use this version:
-- CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_AthletesByTeam AS
-- SELECT TeamCountry AS TeamCode, COUNT(*) AS AthleteCount
-- FROM dbo.vw_Athletes
-- GROUP BY TeamCountry;
If you want, I can tailor the athletes views as well—just send me the column list for vw_Athletes (run:

SELECT COLUMN_NAME 
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 
WHERE TABLE_NAME='vw_Athletes' ORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION;
).

You said:
Wait why are we complicating like this please just we keep the basics create views and that is all
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11s
Totally—let’s keep it simple: just create the basic views over your Delta folders.

Save this as sql/04_create_views.sql and run it in Synapse Studio → Built-in → Use database = OlympicLake.

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- ===== Base views only (no extra analytics) =====

-- Athletes
IF OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.vw_Athletes', N'V') IS NOT NULL DROP VIEW dbo.vw_Athletes;
GO
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_Athletes AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS src;
GO

-- Medals
IF OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.vw_Medals', N'V') IS NOT NULL DROP VIEW dbo.vw_Medals;
GO
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_Medals AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/medals/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS src;
GO

-- Coaches
IF OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.vw_Coaches', N'V') IS NOT NULL DROP VIEW dbo.vw_Coaches;
GO
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_Coaches AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/coaches/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS src;
GO

-- EntriesGender
IF OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.vw_EntriesGender', N'V') IS NOT NULL DROP VIEW dbo.vw_EntriesGender;
GO
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_EntriesGender AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/entriesgender/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS src;
GO

-- Teams
IF OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.vw_Teams', N'V') IS NOT NULL DROP VIEW dbo.vw_Teams;
GO
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_Teams AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/teams/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS src;
GO
Quick test after running:

SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Athletes;
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Medals;
That’s it—clean base views only. If any folder name differs, just change the BULK 'transformed-data/<folder>/' path for that view.

You said:
Perfect my friend thank you very much
ChatGPT said:
You’re welcome! 🙌
Glad it’s all working.

If you want quick next steps:

Hook Power BI to Synapse → OlympicLake and use your vw_* views.

Commit the scripts to sql/ in your repo so others can reproduce.

Need a tiny README section for the sql/ folder or a Power BI connection blurb? I can whip that up.

You said:
I need to add this to github now. We finished with notebooks
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16s
Awesome—let’s get everything into GitHub cleanly. Here’s a quick, no-drama checklist you can follow from the GitHub web UI.

1) Final repo structure
Olympic-Data-Analytics-Azure
│
├── images/
│   ├── architecture.png           # exported PNG
│   └── architecture.drawio        # source diagram
│
├── notebooks/
│   └── olympics_etl.py            # Databricks notebook exported as .py
│
├── sql/
│   ├── 01_create_master_key.sql
│   ├── 02_create_external_objects.sql
│   ├── 03_test_delta_query.sql
│   └── 04_create_views.sql
│
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
2) Add the images
In your repo, click Add file → Upload files.

Drag in:

architecture.png

architecture.drawio

In the “Commit changes” box use a clear message, e.g.:

docs(images): add architecture diagram (png + drawio)

Commit.

Tip: name the PNG exactly images/architecture.png so your README link is easy.

3) Add the sql folder & scripts
You can create each file directly in the right path:

Click Add file → Create new file.

In the filename box type: sql/01_create_master_key.sql.

Paste your script contents.

Commit with: feat(sql): add 01 create master key.

Repeat for:

sql/02_create_external_objects.sql

sql/03_test_delta_query.sql

sql/04_create_views.sql

(Or use Add file → Upload files and drag all four at once.)

4) Confirm the notebook is in place
You already added notebooks/olympics_etl.py. If not:

Add file → Upload files → drop olympics_etl.py (path: notebooks/).

Commit: feat(notebooks): add olympics ETL notebook (.py export).

5) Add a simple .gitignore (recommended)
Add file → Create new file → .gitignore (root), paste:

# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd

# Databricks / notebooks
.ipynb_checkpoints/
*.dbc

# IDE / OS
.vscode/
.idea/
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Env
.env
Commit: chore: add .gitignore.

6) Link the diagram in README.md
Edit README.md and add this where you show Architecture:

## 🏗️ Architecture

![Architecture](images/architecture.png)
Commit: docs(readme): embed architecture diagram + instructions.

7) (Optional) Add a “How to run” block in README
## 🚀 Run the SQL (Synapse serverless)

1. Open Synapse Studio → **Built-in** pool.
2. Run in order:
   - `sql/01_create_master_key.sql`
   - `sql/02_create_external_objects.sql`
   - `sql/03_test_delta_query.sql` (sanity check)
   - `sql/04_create_views.sql`
3. Connect Power BI to **OlympicLake** and use the `vw_*` views.
Nice commit messages you can reuse
docs(images): add architecture diagram (png + drawio)

feat(sql): add external data source + delta views

feat(notebooks): add olympics ETL notebook (.py export)

chore: add .gitignore

docs(readme): embed architecture diagram + run steps

If you want, paste your repo URL and I’ll give you a tiny PR-style checklist you can copy into the description for a polished look.

You said:
sql  the folder should be named sql or?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6s
Yes—sql/ at the repo root is perfect and the most common choice.
GitHub will create the folder automatically when you make a file like sql/01_create_master_key.sql.

If you want to be extra explicit later, alternatives are synapse-sql/ or database/, but for this project sql/ is ideal.

Put your four scripts there:

sql/01_create_master_key.sql

sql/02_create_external_objects.sql

sql/03_test_delta_query.sql

sql/04_create_views.sql

You said:
03_test_delta_query.sql do I need this or directly views
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6s
Short answer: you can skip 03_test_delta_query.sql.

It’s just a sanity check to verify ACLs/paths.

Since your OPENROWSET ... FORMAT='DELTA' query already worked, you can go straight to 04_create_views.sql after running 01 and 02.

That said, I recommend keeping 03 in the repo for others (or future you) to quickly troubleshoot if something breaks.

If you want a tiny 03_test_delta_query.sql, here’s a minimal version:

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- Quick sanity checks (adjust folder names if needed)
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/athletes/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
GO

SELECT TOP 5 * FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'transformed-data/medals/',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'OlympicDataLake',
  FORMAT = 'DELTA'
) AS rows;
GO
Next steps:

Ensure 01_create_master_key.sql and 02_create_external_objects.sql are run.

Run 04_create_views.sql.

Connect Power BI to OlympicLake and use the vw_* views.

You said:
No for the github I guess I do not need it right
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
Yep — you can omit 03_test_delta_query.sql from the GitHub repo. It’s just a sanity-check script.

Clean repo structure (without 03)
sql/
  01_create_master_key.sql
  02_create_external_objects.sql
  04_create_views.sql
README run order
Run sql/01_create_master_key.sql

Run sql/02_create_external_objects.sql

Run sql/04_create_views.sql

Test quickly:

SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Athletes;
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Medals;
If you ever want a troubleshooting step later, you can add the tiny test script back in—but it’s not required for a clean portfolio repo.

You said:
create_views.sql will be 03 right
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
Yep — since you’re skipping the test script, rename it to keep the sequence clean:

Final naming
sql/
  01_create_master_key.sql
  02_create_external_objects.sql
  03_create_views.sql   <-- (was 04)
Update your README run order
sql/01_create_master_key.sql

sql/02_create_external_objects.sql

sql/03_create_views.sql

How to rename in GitHub UI
Open the file → Edit (pencil) → change the name to sql/03_create_views.sql → Commit changes.

Tip: make sure 03_create_views.sql starts with:

USE OlympicLake;
GO
so it always runs in the right DB.

You said:
Can we run some queries for test now please in 04
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 10s
Absolutely—let’s add a small test script you can run after creating the views.
Save this as sql/04_test_queries.sql, then run it in Synapse (Built-in, Use database = OlympicLake).

USE OlympicLake;
GO

/* ===========================

SELECT 'vw_Athletes'      AS view_name, COUNT_BIG(*) AS row_count FROM dbo.vw_Athletes
UNION ALL
SELECT 'vw_Medals'        AS view_name, COUNT_BIG(*) FROM dbo.vw_Medals

-- -- Athletes by NOC (if vw_Athletes has 'NOC'; otherwise switch to TeamCountry)
-- SELECT NOC, COUNT(*) AS AthleteCount
-- FROM dbo.vw_Athletes

If you prefer keeping your repo minimal, you can still run these directly without committing the file—but having 04_test_queries.sql makes troubleshooting super quick later.

You said:
Can I send you the columns of all files and you create some queries
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16s
Absolutely — send me the column lists and I’ll tailor the queries exactly to your schema.

If it’s easier, you can grab the columns from Synapse with these one-liners and paste the results here:

USE OlympicLake; -- make sure you're in your DB
GO
SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME='vw_Athletes'
ORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION;

SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME='vw_Medals'
ORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION;

SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME='vw_Coaches'
ORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION;

SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME='vw_EntriesGender'
ORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION;

SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME='vw_Teams'
ORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION;
Paste the outputs (or just the column names) and I’ll craft a clean set of queries/views for you.

While you collect columns — a small “starter” query pack you can run now
These should work with the Medals schema you showed earlier (TeamCountry, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total, ...). If any field names differ on your side, I’ll adjust after you share the schemas.

USE OlympicLake;
GO

-- 1) Quick counts
SELECT COUNT_BIG(*) AS Athletes FROM dbo.vw_Athletes;
SELECT COUNT_BIG(*) AS Medals   FROM dbo.vw_Medals;
SELECT COUNT_BIG(*) AS Coaches  FROM dbo.vw_Coaches;
SELECT COUNT_BIG(*) AS Entries  FROM dbo.vw_EntriesGender;
SELECT COUNT_BIG(*) AS Teams    FROM dbo.vw_Teams;
GO

-- 2) Medal tally by country (aggregate schema)
SELECT

  SUM(TRY_CAST(Gold   AS BIGINT))  AS Gold,
  SUM(TRY_CAST(Silver AS BIGINT))  AS Silver,
  SUM(TRY_CAST(Bronze AS BIGINT))  AS Bronze,
  SUM(TRY_CAST(Total  AS BIGINT))  AS TotalMedals
FROM dbo.vw_Medals
GROUP BY TeamCountry
ORDER BY TotalMedals DESC;
GO

-- 3) Top 10 countries by total medals
SELECT TOP 10
  TeamCountry,
  SUM(TRY_CAST(Total AS BIGINT)) AS TotalMedals
FROM dbo.vw_Medals
GROUP BY TeamCountry
ORDER BY TotalMedals DESC;
GO

-- 4) Gender distribution (if vw_Athletes has a Gender column)
-- (If your athletes table uses a different field, tell me and I'll switch it.)
SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) AS Athletes
FROM dbo.vw_Athletes
GROUP BY Gender
ORDER BY Athletes DESC;
GO

-- 5) Athletes by team code (try NOC first; if not present, we can use TeamCountry)
-- SELECT NOC AS TeamCode, COUNT(*) AS AthleteCount
-- FROM dbo.vw_Athletes
-- GROUP BY NOC
-- ORDER BY AthleteCount DESC;
Send the column lists when you’re ready, and I’ll turn these into polished, schema-accurate queries (and optional Power BI-friendly views) for your repo.

Optional Git LFS if storing .pbix:

# .gitattributes (root)
*.pbix filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
3) data/ (links + small samples)
Keep the repo light but helpful.

# data/README.md
This project uses public Olympic CSVs.
Source (examples): Athletes, Coaches, Teams, Medals, EntriesGender.
- Athletes.csv – link to source
- Coaches.csv – link to source
- Teams.csv – link to source
- Medals.csv – link to source
- EntriesGender.csv – link to source

Note: Raw files are ingested via ADF to ADLS `raw-data/` and transformed to Delta in `transformed-data/`.
(Optional) Include 100-row samples in data/sample/.
4) .gitignore (root)
(if you haven’t already)

# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# Notebooks/Databricks
.ipynb_checkpoints/

5) README touch-ups
Add these small sections so reviewers know how to run your SQL:

## 🔧 Setup (Synapse serverless)
Run in order:
1. `sql/01_create_master_key.sql`
2. `sql/02_create_external_objects.sql`
3. `sql/03_create_views.sql`
4. (optional) `sql/04_test_queries.sql`

**Requirements**
- Synapse workspace Managed Identity has `Storage Blob Data Reader` RBAC
- ADLS Gen2 ACLs `r+x` for the workspace at:
  - `/tokyo-olumpic-data` (root)
  - `/transformed-data`
  - each dataset folder (`athletes`, `medals`, `coaches`, `entriesgender`, `teams`)
6) LICENSE (if missing)
MIT is fine for a portfolio project:

MIT License

Copyright (c) 2025 <Your Name>

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy...
7) Nice-to-have repo metadata
Set repo Description + Topics: azure, data-engineering, lakehouse, databricks, synapse, powerbi.

Add a Project Structure block in your README.

Add a short Troubleshooting note (e.g., ACL r+x on container/folders, Built-in pool, DB context = OlympicLake).

✍️ Quick commit plan
docs(images): add architecture diagram (png + drawio)

feat(sql): add create_views + test_queries

feat(pipelines): add ADF export and readme

feat(dashboards): add pbix + preview

docs(data): add data/README with source links

chore: add .gitignore and optional .gitattributes (LFS)

If you want, paste your repo URL and I’ll suggest a short, clean README “Project Structure” section tailored to what’s actually in your tree right now.

You said:
So next is pipelines folder right?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 18s
Yep — next up is the pipelines/ folder ✅
Since you already built your ADF ingestion, the cleanest move is to export the ADF ARM template and commit it. That way anyone can re-deploy your pipeline from the repo.

Step 1) Export your ADF as an ARM template
In Azure Data Factory Studio:

Left sidebar → Manage (wrench icon).

ARM template → Export ARM template.

It downloads a zip. Unzip it; you’ll see files like:

ARMTemplateForFactory.json

ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json

(sometimes) linkedTemplates/*

If you used Synapse pipelines instead of ADF, do the same in Synapse Studio → Manage → ARM template → Export and place under pipelines/synapse/.

Step 2) Add to GitHub
Using the web UI:

In your repo → Add file → Upload files.

Target path: pipelines/adf/.

Upload:

ARMTemplateForFactory.json

ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json

any linkedTemplates/ files

Commit with a clear message, e.g.
feat(pipelines): add ADF ARM template export

Step 3) Include a tiny README alongside it (recommended)
Create pipelines/README.md with this content (copy/paste):

# Pipelines

This folder contains deployment templates for orchestration.

## Azure Data Factory (ADF)

Files:
- `adf/ARMTemplateForFactory.json`
- `adf/ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json`
- `adf/linkedTemplates/` (if present)

### Deploy (Portal)
1. Azure Portal → **Create a resource** → **Template deployment** → **Build your own template**.
2. **Load file** → select `ARMTemplateForFactory.json`.
3. Fill parameters (factory name, location, storage account, container, paths).
4. **Review + create**.

> Secrets (keys, SAS, connection strings) should not be committed. Use **Managed Identity** or **Key Vault** in linked services.

### What this template includes
- Pipelines (Copy from source → ADLS `raw-data/`).
- Datasets (HTTP/Blob/ADLS as used).
- Linked services (parameterized to avoid secrets in repo).
Step 4) (Optional) Add a minimal sample pipeline JSON
If you prefer having a small example in addition to the ARM export, create pipelines/examples/README.md and jot what it does. But since you have a real ADF, the ARM export is the source of truth.

Parameter tips (so your template is reusable)
Parameterize at least:

Storage account name (e.g., tokyoolympicdatajovan)

Container (e.g., tokyo-olumpic-data)

Raw path prefix (e.g., raw-data/)

Source URLs (CSV links) if you hard-coded them

Keep linked services on Managed Identity (no secrets in repo).

Quick checklist
 Create pipelines/adf/ in GitHub and upload ARM files

 Add pipelines/README.md

 Ensure no secrets are in JSON (Managed Identity or Key Vault only)

 Update main README.md with a short “How to deploy pipelines” link to pipelines/README.md

If you want, tell me whether you used ADF only or also Synapse pipelines, and I’ll tailor the exact README block + parameter notes to your setup.

You said:
ADF
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 14s
Great — since you’re using ADF, here’s the quickest way to add your pipelines to GitHub cleanly and make them redeployable.

1) Export from ADF Studio
In Data Factory Studio:

Manage (wrench) → ARM template

Export ARM template → download the ZIP

Unzip locally; you’ll see:

ARMTemplateForFactory.json

ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json

(maybe) linkedTemplates/ folder

2) Add to your repo
Create this structure and upload via GitHub web UI:

pipelines/
  adf/
    ARMTemplateForFactory.json
    ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json
    linkedTemplates/           # (if present)
  README.md
Commit message idea:

feat(pipelines): add ADF ARM template export
3) Minimal README for pipelines/
Copy this into pipelines/README.md:

# Pipelines

This folder contains the **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** ARM templates for this project.

## Files
- `adf/ARMTemplateForFactory.json` — resources (pipelines, datasets, linked services)
- `adf/ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json` — parameters scaffold
- `adf/linkedTemplates/` — nested templates (if any)

## Deploy via Portal
1. Azure Portal → **Create a resource** → **Template deployment (deploy using custom templates)**.
2. **Build your own template in the editor** → **Load file** → select `ARMTemplateForFactory.json`.
3. Fill parameters (factory name, location, storage account, container, paths) → **Review + create**.

## Deploy via CLI
```bash
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group <RG_NAME> \
  --template-file pipelines/adf/ARMTemplateForFactory.json \
  --parameters @pipelines/adf/ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json \
  --parameters factoryName=<ADF_NAME> \
               location=<azure-region> \
               storageAccountName=<yourStorage> \
               containerName=<yourContainer> \
               rawPathPrefix=raw-data/
Notes
No secrets in Git: use Managed Identity or Key Vault for linked services.

If your export contains keys/connection strings in typeProperties, parameterize or scrub them before committing.

This project ingests CSVs to adls://<account>/<container>/raw-data/ and transforms to Delta under transformed-data/.


## 4) (Optional) Parameter skeleton
If your `ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json` is empty-ish, you can add a friendly example (update names to match your template’s parameters):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "factoryName":         { "value": "adf-olympics-jovan" },
    "location":            { "value": "westeurope" },
    "storageAccountName":  { "value": "tokyoolympicdatajovan" },
    "containerName":       { "value": "tokyo-olumpic-data" },
    "rawPathPrefix":       { "value": "raw-data/" },
    "keyVaultName":        { "value": "kv-olympics-jovan" }   // if using Key Vault
  }
}
5) Quick hygiene
Add/keep .gitignore at repo root (ignore .dbc, __pycache__/, etc.).

In your main README, add a short “Deploy ADF” link to pipelines/README.md.

That’s it. Upload the ADF export ZIP contents into pipelines/adf/, add the README, and you’re golden. If you want, paste the parameter names your export uses and I’ll tailor the CLI command + sample parameters exactly to them.

You said:
Wait I do not get it what to do now 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6s
No worries—here’s the super short, do-this-next version for ADF pipelines.

What you’re doing
Add your ADF export to your repo under pipelines/adf/ so others can redeploy your pipeline.

A) Export from ADF (one-time)
Open Data Factory Studio.

Left sidebar → Manage (wrench).

ARM template → Export ARM template.

A ZIP downloads. Unzip it — you’ll see:

ARMTemplateForFactory.json

ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json

(maybe) a linkedTemplates/ folder

B) Put it in GitHub
In your repo → Add file → Upload files.

In the path box at the top, type: pipelines/adf/

Drag in:

ARMTemplateForFactory.json

ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json

the whole linkedTemplates/ folder (if present)

Commit message: feat(pipelines): add ADF ARM template export

C) (Nice to have) Add a tiny README next to it
Create pipelines/README.md with this:

# Pipelines

Azure Data Factory export for this project.

## Files
- `adf/ARMTemplateForFactory.json`
- `adf/ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json`
- `adf/linkedTemplates/` (if present)

## Deploy (Portal)
Azure Portal → Create a resource → Template deployment → Build your own template → Load `ARMTemplateForFactory.json` → fill parameters → Deploy.

> Use Managed Identity / Key Vault. Do not commit secrets.
If you don’t have the export yet
You can still create the folders now:

In GitHub: Add file → Create new file → name it pipelines/adf/.gitkeep → Commit.

Add the files later once you export from ADF.

Want me to stay with you while you click through the ADF export, or would you prefer I draft a sample ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json you can tweak?

Perfect — I peeked inside your ZIP and it has exactly what we need:

Contents:

ARMTemplateForFactory.json

ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json

linkedTemplates/ArmTemplate_0.json

linkedTemplates/ArmTemplate_master.json

linkedTemplates/ArmTemplateParameters_master.json

(also a factory/ subfolder with duplicates — fine to include)

Here’s what to do now:

Put these in your repo
In GitHub Web UI:

Commit message: feat(pipelines): add ADF ARM template export

Add a tiny README next to it (recommended)
Create pipelines/README.md:

# Pipelines

Azure Data Factory (ADF) ARM export for this project.

## Files
- `adf/ARMTemplateForFactory.json`
- `adf/ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json`
- `adf/linkedTemplates/*`
- `adf/factory/*` (exported variants)

## Deploy (Portal)
Azure Portal → **Create a resource** → **Template deployment** → **Build your own template** → **Load file** (`ARMTemplateForFactory.json`) → fill parameters → **Review + create**.

> Use Managed Identity / Key Vault. Do not commit secrets.
Quick hygiene check (important)
Your template references accountKey in typeProperties. Make sure:

It’s parameterized or read from Key Vault, not a hard-coded secret.

If any secret snuck in, remove it from the JSON and re-export with Managed Identity/Key Vault.

Optional: CLI deploy snippet (paste into README if you like)
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group <RG_NAME> \
  --template-file pipelines/adf/ARMTemplateForFactory.json \
  --parameters @pipelines/adf/ARMTemplateParametersForFactory.json
That’s it — upload those files under pipelines/adf/, add the small README, and you’re done with the pipelines part. Want me to draft a short “How to deploy ADF” section for your main README as well?

- EntriesGender.csv – https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darshilparmar/olympic-data/main/EntriesGender.csv

> The Databricks notebook ingests these into ADLS `raw-data/` and writes Delta tables into `transformed-data/`.
3) Update your main README.md (tiny section)
Add a quick “Run without ADF” note:

## 🚀 How to Run (no ADF export)

1) Databricks (ingestion + transform)
   - Import `notebooks/olympics_etl.py`
   - Configure ADLS mount/path
   - Run notebook to write Delta tables to:
     - `abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net/transformed-data/<table>/`

2) Synapse serverless
   - Run in order:
     - `sql/01_create_master_key.sql`
     - `sql/02_create_external_objects.sql`
     - `sql/03_create_views.sql`
     - `sql/04_test_queries.sql` (sanity checks)
   - Ensure Synapse MI has `Storage Blob Data Reader` (RBAC) **and** ADLS ACLs `r+x` on:
     - container root `/tokyo-olumpic-data`
     - `/transformed-data`
     - each dataset folder (`athletes`, `medals`, `coaches`, `entriesgender`, `teams`)

3) Power BI
   - Get Data → Azure Synapse Analytics (SQL)
   - Connect to database `OlympicLake`
   - Use views: `vw_Athletes`, `vw_Medals`, `vw_Coaches`, `vw_EntriesGender`, `vw_Teams`
4) (Optional) dashboards/
If you have a PBIX, add it plus a screenshot. If not, just drop a screenshot later and a short README.

5) .gitignore (if you haven’t added it yet)
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.ipynb_checkpoints/
*.dbc
.vscode/
.idea/
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
.env
6) Polishing touches
Set repo Description and Topics: azure, databricks, synapse, delta-lake, powerbi, data-engineering.

In README, embed the architecture:

![Architecture](images/architecture.png)
If you want, I can produce a crisp final README.md for your repo including the sections above—just say the word and I’ll draft it exactly to match your structure.

Awesome—here’s a cleaned-up, complete README you can paste over your current one. I baked in everything we set up (storage names, Synapse DB, views, run order, ACL checklist, etc.), and kept it tidy for recruiters.

🏅 Olympic-Data-Analytics — Azure End-to-End Data Engineering Project
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on Microsoft Azure using publicly available Olympic Games datasets.

Raw CSVs are ingested into a data lake, transformed to Delta Lake tables, and served to BI/analytics through Synapse serverless SQL and Power BI—following a modern lakehouse approach.

Stack

Azure Data Factory (optional for ingestion)

Azure Databricks (transformations, Delta writes)

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (raw + transformed zones)

Azure Synapse Analytics (serverless SQL) (views over Delta)

Power BI (dashboards)

🏗️ Architecture
<!-- Update the image path if needed -->

Flow

Data Sources → CSVs (Athletes, Coaches, Medals, Teams, EntriesGender)

Ingestion (ADF or Databricks) → adls://<account>/<container>/raw-data/

Transformations (Databricks) → clean, model, and write Delta to
abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net/transformed-data/<table>/

Serving (Synapse serverless SQL) → views directly over Delta

Visualization (Power BI) → reports from Synapse views

Medallion

Bronze → raw-data/ (landing CSVs)

Silver/Gold → transformed-data/ (Delta tables curated for analytics)

We intentionally omitted ADF ARM exports from this repo to keep it lightweight. Ingestion is documented below.

⚙️ Technologies Used
ADF → (optional) pipelines to copy CSVs to raw-data/

ADLS Gen2 → lake storage (raw & transformed)

Databricks + Delta Lake → cleaning & transformations, write Delta tables

Synapse serverless SQL → views over Delta for BI

Power BI → interactive dashboards

🚀 Getting Started
✅ Prerequisites
Azure subscription (Free Trial or Pay-As-You-Go)

Resource Group with:

ADLS Gen2 storage account: tokyoolympicdatajovan

Container: tokyo-olumpic-data

Databricks Workspace

Synapse Workspace

Power BI Desktop (local)

1) Ingest & Transform (Databricks)
Import notebooks/olympics_etl.py into Databricks.

Configure input CSV locations (public raw links or ADF-landed files under raw-data/).

Run the notebook to write Delta tables to:

abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net/transformed-data/
  ├─ athletes/
  ├─ medals/
  ├─ coaches/
  ├─ entriesgender/
  └─ teams/
Each target folder must contain a _delta_log/ (Delta table).

(Optional) If you prefer ADF for ingestion: build copy pipelines to land CSVs to raw-data/, then have Databricks read raw-data/ and write to transformed-data/.

2) Grant Access (critical)
Synapse serverless uses your workspace managed identity (e.g., tokyo-olympic-sn). You must grant both RBAC and ACLs:

RBAC (Storage account → IAM):

Role: Storage Blob Data Reader

Assign to: Synapse workspace managed identity

ADLS ACLs (POSIX) — give Read (r) + Execute (x) to tokyo-olympic-sn at:

/tokyo-olumpic-data (container root) → r+x

/tokyo-olumpic-data/transformed-data → r+x

Each dataset folder under transformed-data (athletes, medals, coaches, entriesgender, teams) → r+x

Tip: Do this in Azure Storage Explorer to apply recursively; Portal works too but needs per-folder clicks.

Networking (if restricted):

Storage account → Networking → enable Trusted Microsoft services (or allow all networks during testing).

3) Synapse Setup (serverless SQL)
Open Synapse Studio → Develop (</>) → SQL script.
Always use Connect to: Built-in and Use database: OlympicLake.

Run in this order:

sql/01_create_master_key.sql
Creates the Database Master Key (required before credentials).

USE OlympicLake;
GO
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.symmetric_keys WHERE name='##MS_DatabaseMasterKey##')
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'YourStrongPassword123!';
GO
If OlympicLake doesn’t exist yet, first run:
IF DB_ID('OlympicLake') IS NULL CREATE DATABASE OlympicLake;

sql/02_create_external_objects.sql
Creates the credential (Managed Identity) and external data source:

USE OlympicLake;
GO
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_scoped_credentials WHERE name='SynapseManagedIdentity')
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity
WITH IDENTITY='Managed Identity';
GO

IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name='OlympicDataLake')
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake
WITH (
  LOCATION='abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net',
  CREDENTIAL=SynapseManagedIdentity
);
GO
sql/03_create_views.sql
Creates base views directly over Delta folders:

dbo.vw_Athletes → transformed-data/athletes/

dbo.vw_Medals → transformed-data/medals/

dbo.vw_Coaches → transformed-data/coaches/

dbo.vw_EntriesGender → transformed-data/entriesgender/

dbo.vw_Teams → transformed-data/teams/

We use OPENROWSET … FORMAT='DELTA' (schema-on-read).
If you later need strict schemas, add a WITH (...) column list in each OPENROWSET.

sql/04_test_queries.sql
Quick sanity checks (view existence, counts, sample rows) and a few simple insights (e.g., medal tallies by TeamCountry).

4) Power BI
Get Data → Azure Synapse Analytics (SQL).

Connect to the serverless endpoint, pick database = OlympicLake.

Select views: vw_Athletes, vw_Medals, vw_Coaches, vw_EntriesGender, vw_Teams.

Build visuals (e.g., Top countries by Total, Athletes by Discipline, Gender distribution).

🧪 Smoke Tests (run in Synapse)
USE OlympicLake;
GO
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Athletes;
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Medals;
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Coaches;
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_EntriesGender;
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Teams;
If these return rows, your pipeline + permissions are good.

🔧 Troubleshooting
“Referenced external data source not found”
→ You’re in the wrong DB. Switch to Use database: OlympicLake and re-run 02_create_external_objects.sql.

“Please create a master key…”
→ Run 01_create_master_key.sql first in OlympicLake.

“Content of directory … cannot be listed.”
→ Missing ACLs. Ensure tokyo-olympic-sn has r+x at root, /transformed-data, and each dataset folder.
→ Also check storage networking (Trusted Microsoft services).

View errors like “Invalid column name 'Medal'.”
→ Your Medals table is already aggregated (e.g., TeamCountry, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total). Use those fields in queries.

📚 Data Sources
Keep the repo small; link to raw CSVs (example source):

Athletes.csv

Coaches.csv

Medals.csv

Teams.csv

The Databricks notebook ingests these and writes Delta to /transformed-data/.

What changed vs your draft
Tightened language, headings, and bullets for scannability.

Added project structure, exact Azure names, Synapse run order, ACL checklist, smoke tests, and troubleshooting.

Kept ADF optional (since we’re not committing ARM templates).

If you want, I can also drop this README into your repo text-ready with your exact diagram filename and any dashboard screenshots once you add them.

ChatGPT says: Awesome—here’s a cleaned-up, complete README you can paste over your current one. I baked in everything we set up (storage names, Synapse DB, views, run order, ACL checklist, etc.), and kept it tidy for recruiters. --- # 🏅 Olympic-Data-Analytics — Azure End-to-End Data Engineering Project ## 📌 Overview This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data engineering pipeline on Microsoft Azure** using publicly available **Olympic Games datasets**. Raw CSVs are ingested into a data lake, transformed to **Delta Lake** tables, and served to **BI/analytics** through **Synapse serverless SQL** and **Power BI**—following a modern **lakehouse** approach. **Stack** - **Azure Data Factory** (optional for ingestion) - **Azure Databricks** (transformations, Delta writes) - **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** (raw + transformed zones) - **Azure Synapse Analytics (serverless SQL)** (views over Delta) - **Power BI** (dashboards) --- ## 🏗️ Architecture ![Architecture](images/architecture.png) <!-- Update the image path if needed --> **Flow** 1. **Data Sources** → CSVs (Athletes, Coaches, Medals, Teams, EntriesGender) 2. **Ingestion** (ADF or Databricks) → `adls://<account>/<container>/raw-data/` 3. **Transformations** (Databricks) → clean, model, and **write Delta** to `abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net/transformed-data/<table>/` 4. **Serving** (Synapse serverless SQL) → **views** directly over Delta 5. **Visualization** (Power BI) → reports from Synapse views **Medallion** - **Bronze** → `raw-data/` (landing CSVs) - **Silver/Gold** → `transformed-data/` (Delta tables curated for analytics) --- ## 📂 Project Structure ``` . ├─ images/ │ ├─ architecture.png │ └─ architecture.drawio ├─ notebooks/ │ └─ olympics_etl.py ├─ sql/ │ ├─ 01_create_master_key.sql │ ├─ 02_create_external_objects.sql │ ├─ 03_create_views.sql │ └─ 04_test_queries.sql ├─ dashboards/ # optional (Power BI .pbix + screenshots) ├─ data/ # optional (README with source links) ├─ .gitignore ├─ LICENSE └─ README.md ``` > We intentionally **omitted ADF ARM exports** from this repo to keep it lightweight. Ingestion is documented below. --- ## ⚙️ Technologies Used - **ADF** → (optional) pipelines to copy CSVs to `raw-data/` - **ADLS Gen2** → lake storage (raw & transformed) - **Databricks + Delta Lake** → cleaning & transformations, write **Delta** tables - **Synapse serverless SQL** → **views** over Delta for BI - **Power BI** → interactive dashboards --- ## 🚀 Getting Started ### ✅ Prerequisites - Azure subscription (Free Trial or Pay-As-You-Go) - **Resource Group** with: - **ADLS Gen2** storage account: `tokyoolympicdatajovan` - **Container**: `tokyo-olumpic-data` - **Databricks Workspace** - **Synapse Workspace** - **Power BI Desktop** (local) --- ## 1) Ingest & Transform (Databricks) 1. Import `notebooks/olympics_etl.py` into Databricks. 2. Configure input CSV locations (public raw links or ADF-landed files under `raw-data/`). 3. Run the notebook to **write Delta tables** to: ``` abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net/transformed-data/ ├─ athletes/ ├─ medals/ ├─ coaches/ ├─ entriesgender/ └─ teams/ ``` > Each target folder must contain a **`_delta_log/`** (Delta table). *(Optional)* If you prefer ADF for ingestion: build copy pipelines to land CSVs to `raw-data/`, then have Databricks read `raw-data/` and write to `transformed-data/`. --- ## 2) Grant Access (critical) Synapse serverless uses your **workspace managed identity** (e.g., `tokyo-olympic-sn`). You must grant both **RBAC** and **ACLs**: **RBAC** (Storage account → IAM): - Role: **Storage Blob Data Reader** - Assign to: **Synapse workspace managed identity** **ADLS ACLs** (POSIX) — give **Read (r)** + **Execute (x)** to `tokyo-olympic-sn` at: - `/tokyo-olumpic-data` (container root) → **r+x** - `/tokyo-olumpic-data/transformed-data` → **r+x** - Each dataset folder under `transformed-data` (athletes, medals, coaches, entriesgender, teams) → **r+x** > Tip: Do this in **Azure Storage Explorer** to **apply recursively**; Portal works too but needs per-folder clicks. **Networking** (if restricted): - Storage account → Networking → enable **Trusted Microsoft services** (or allow all networks during testing). --- ## 3) Synapse Setup (serverless SQL) Open **Synapse Studio** → **Develop (</>)** → **SQL script**. Always use **Connect to: Built-in** and **Use database: `OlympicLake`**. Run in this order: ### `sql/01_create_master_key.sql` Creates the **Database Master Key** (required before credentials). ```sql USE OlympicLake; GO IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.symmetric_keys WHERE name='##MS_DatabaseMasterKey##') CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'YourStrongPassword123!'; GO ``` > If `OlympicLake` doesn’t exist yet, first run: > `IF DB_ID('OlympicLake') IS NULL CREATE DATABASE OlympicLake;` ### `sql/02_create_external_objects.sql` Creates the **credential** (Managed Identity) and **external data source**: ```sql USE OlympicLake; GO IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.database_scoped_credentials WHERE name='SynapseManagedIdentity') CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SynapseManagedIdentity WITH IDENTITY='Managed Identity'; GO IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name='OlympicDataLake') CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE OlympicDataLake WITH ( LOCATION='abfss://tokyo-olumpic-data@tokyoolympicdatajovan.dfs.core.windows.net', CREDENTIAL=SynapseManagedIdentity ); GO ``` ### `sql/03_create_views.sql` Creates **base views** directly over Delta folders: - `dbo.vw_Athletes` → `transformed-data/athletes/` - `dbo.vw_Medals` → `transformed-data/medals/` - `dbo.vw_Coaches` → `transformed-data/coaches/` - `dbo.vw_EntriesGender` → `transformed-data/entriesgender/` - `dbo.vw_Teams` → `transformed-data/teams/` > We use `OPENROWSET … FORMAT='DELTA'` (schema-on-read). > If you later need strict schemas, add a `WITH (...)` column list in each `OPENROWSET`. ### `sql/04_test_queries.sql` Quick sanity checks (view existence, counts, sample rows) and a few simple insights (e.g., medal tallies by `TeamCountry`). --- ## 4) Power BI 1. **Get Data** → **Azure Synapse Analytics (SQL)**. 2. Connect to the serverless endpoint, pick **database = `OlympicLake`**. 3. Select views: `vw_Athletes`, `vw_Medals`, `vw_Coaches`, `vw_EntriesGender`, `vw_Teams`. 4. Build visuals (e.g., **Top countries by Total**, **Athletes by Discipline**, **Gender distribution**). --- ## 🧪 Smoke Tests (run in Synapse) ```sql USE OlympicLake; GO SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Athletes; SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Medals; SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Coaches; SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_EntriesGender; SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.vw_Teams; ``` If these return rows, your pipeline + permissions are good. --- ## 🔧 Troubleshooting - **“Referenced external data source not found”** → You’re in the wrong DB. Switch to **Use database: OlympicLake** and re-run `02_create_external_objects.sql`. - **“Please create a master key…”** → Run `01_create_master_key.sql` first in **OlympicLake**. - **“Content of directory … cannot be listed.”** → Missing **ACLs**. Ensure `tokyo-olympic-sn` has **r+x** at **root**, **/transformed-data**, and each **dataset folder**. → Also check storage networking (Trusted Microsoft services). - **View errors like “Invalid column name 'Medal'.”** → Your **Medals** table is already aggregated (e.g., `TeamCountry, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total`). Use those fields in queries. --- ## 📚 Data Sources Keep the repo small; link to raw CSVs (example source): - Athletes.csv - Coaches.csv - Medals.csv - Teams.csv - EntriesGender.csv > The Databricks notebook ingests these and writes **Delta** to `/transformed-data/`. (If you add a `data/README.md`, place the links there.) --- ## 🔒 Notes on Security - Use **Managed Identity** or **Key Vault** for secrets. - Do **not** commit secrets/keys to Git. - RBAC + ACLs are both required for ADLS Gen2 access from Synapse. --- ## 📝 License MIT (or your preferred license—this repo includes a `LICENSE` file). --- ## 🙌 Credits - Azure product docs (ADF, Databricks, Synapse, Power BI) - Public Olympic datasets community --- ### What changed vs your draft - Tightened language, headings, and bullets for scannability. - Added **project structure**, **exact Azure names**, **Synapse run order**, **ACL checklist**, **smoke tests**, and **troubleshooting**. - Kept ADF optional (since we’re not committing ARM templates).
